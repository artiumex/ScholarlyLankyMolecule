Latitude is a measurement of the distance of a location either north or south of the Equator. To measure latitude, we use 180 lines, called parallels, that form imaginary circles from east to west around the globe. The Equator, an imaginary line that circles the middle of Earth, is at 0 degrees latitude. The next parallel is one degree north or south of the Equator. The North Pole is at 90 degrees north of the Equator, and the South Pole is at 90 degrees south of the Equator.

Longitude is a measurement of the distance of a location east or west of Greenwich, England. Greenwich is accepted worldwide as the designated 0 degree north-south meridian that travels from the South Pole, through Greenwich, to the North Pole. Similar to parallels, meridians are 180 imaginary lines that circle Earth and meet at the North Pole and the South Pole.

Parallels and meridians form an intersecting grid that covers Earth. Using this grid, we can calculate the latitude and longitude, called coordinates. With these coordinates we can locate any point on Earth.

Measuring Latitude and Longitude
Both latitude and longitude are measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds. The distance between lines is called a degree. One degree of latitude measures about 69 miles. Because of the way the Earth curves, the measurement of longitude depends on its distance from the Equator. The farther the lines are from the Equator, the smaller they are; and right at the North and South poles, the degrees are simply points.

Latitude and longitude are both also measured by dividing the degree into 60 minutes. Each of those minutes is further divided into 60 seconds. One minute of latitude covers about 1.1 miles, and one second of latitude covers about 105 feet.

Finding and Using Latitude and Longitude
To map a location using latitude and longitude, you will need to use a global positioning system (GPS) device and enter the name of the location you’d like to find. If you know the coordinates, you can enter those and it will provide you with the location name.

For example, the coordinates for Vancouver, Canada, are 49° 16' N / 123° 7' W. The latitude is 49 degrees, 16 minutes north of the Equator. The longitude is 123 degrees, 7 minutes west of Greenwich.

Absolute and Relative Locations
Latitude and longitude help us find what geographers call an absolute location, which is the fixed point on Earth of the location. For example, the fixed location of the capital of Argentina, Buenos Aires, is determined by its latitude and longitude, which is 34°36'S/58°22'W.

Geographers also use the term relative location. Relative location describes the location of a place by its relationship to another place. For example, you could describe Hawaii as located east of Japan. Returning to our example of Buenos Aires, Argentina, you could describe it as 613 miles to the east of Mendoza, another city in Argentina. These are relative locations when comparing to other locations.
