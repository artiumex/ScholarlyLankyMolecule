! Section 1

    00:00:02 TEACHER: Hi. My name is Kirsten. And I'm your instructor today. Well, have you ever thought about the way we categorize jobs? Blue collar and white collar are two phrases that you may have heard before. White collar jobs are those that are in professional
    00:00:15 positions: sales, doctors, lawyers, and so forth, or anyone who's at a managerial level. The other type of job is the blue collar job. Those are the hard workers, people who work in construction, manufacturing, or truck driving, for example. Well, when geographers study how economies work and how regions are able to generate wealth, an important thing that they must do is categorize how
    00:00:40 that wealth is generated. What economic sectors does that country or region rely on? And in this section, we're going to take a look at that. This is Global Economic Sectors and Systems. Our objectives, to investigate the five economic sectors, to examine the relationship between comparative advantage and specialization, to identify the four main
    00:01:03 economic systems, and to compare the roles of a formal and informal sector in relation to a country's economy. In this section, we'll be looking at our first two objectives. And as we go along, some of our words and terms will be highlighted in purple. Pay close attention because these are your vocabulary
    00:01:17 words for this section. OK. So let's get started. And we're going to be looking at the different economic sectors. And these five terms are used to describe how we categorize jobs and employment, and economic generation. And we're going to take a look at each of these sectors in
    00:01:36 the first part of this section. So let's get started. The primary economic sector is anything having to do with raw materials. So it includes growing food, for example. Mining, forestry, so cutting down trees, or fishing, all these have to do, again, with raw materials or the actual growing of food, the actual mining of
    00:01:58 resources, and so forth. Now, when we take those resources and we turn them into finished goods, when we take the wheat that we grow and turn it into bread, when we take the iron that we have mined and turn it into steel, now we're dealing with the secondary economic sector. It includes manufacturing, engineering, utilities, construction, and shipbuilding.
    00:02:20 Now, the tertiary economic sector is the one that the United States relies on most. This is how we generate most of our economic wealth. This is anything having to do with services. So it includes sales, transportation, entertainment, banking, and health care. Next, we have the quaternary economic sector. This is anything having to do with education, information,
    00:02:44 or communications, so government, libraries, education, information technology, or research. Now, finally, we have a new economic sector. This is the quinary economic sector. And there is quite a bit of debate about this particular sector. It can be described in many different ways. It includes executive or top-level people in the
    00:03:07 decision making process, so the heads of government, the CEOs of a company. Many people put them in a separate economic sector category, the quinary one. It also is used to describe many specialist tasks, especially those associated with nonprofits. So, for example, if you work for a charity, like the Red Cross, or if you're involved in public safety, fire,
    00:03:32 police, health care, or education, many people also place this in this particular economic sector. Now, many of these jobs, of course, don't fit just into one of these sectors. Many of them can also be put in the service sector, the tertiary economic sector. But again, this is a new thing that you might see. And not everyone subscribes to this particular definition.
    00:03:58 But we are seeing it more and more. So there is a bit of a debate about this particular economic sector. So next, we're going to shift gears a little bit. And we're going to talk about how countries are able to function in a global economy and some of the steps that they have to take. Well, one is comparative advantage.
    00:04:17 Now, comparative advantage is the ability of a country to produce a particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another country. Now, opportunity cost is the value of giving up the next best alternative when making a decision. So here's an example. Let's say that you're going to open a factory. Now, you have a lot of choices about what kind of factory
    00:04:38 that you're going to open. And depending upon what you choose, there's going to be an opportunity cost involved. Let's say that you decided to open a steel factory. Well, the United States has a lot of iron resources. Likely, you could produce steel very, very cheaply. If, however, you decided you wanted to open an olive packaging factory, well, in many parts of the United
    00:05:02 States, olives don't grow very well. So it might be more difficult for you to make a living opening an olive factory than it would be a steel factory. And that difference in profit that you could have made is that opportunity cost. So let's take a look at what opportunity cost has to do with specialization. Comparative advantage and opportunity cost influence
    00:05:22 specialization. So what countries need to do is they don't need to be self-sufficient. In the United States, we don't produce everything we need. We produce a lot of things. And we produce them well. And things that are more difficult for us to produce, we import from another country who does produce them well.
    00:05:39 And a great example is coffee. Coffee grows best at certain altitudes in certain types of climate. We likely could grow coffee in the United States. But it might be very difficult. We might have to do it under artificial conditions. And that would make it very, very expensive. It's much better for us to take our land and produce
    00:05:56 things that we produce well, like corn and soy beans, and then import our coffee from a country that specializes in coffee, like Brazil. Brazil is the world's leading producer of coffee. They have a favorable climate and inexpensive labor. Another example is movies and entertainment. That is something we do very well here in the United States, especially in California.
    00:06:17 Hollywood is one of the world's leading producers of film and entertainment. They have a large pool of talented artists and workers. They have lots of good financing. And as a result, many TV shows watched around the world are actually produced here in the United States. So in review, we talked about economic sectors and how we can divide the ways that countries generate income,
    00:06:39 generate wealth, the jobs that people have into certain sectors. They include primary, secondary, tertiary, quarternary, and quinary economic sectors. And here in the United States, most people work in the tertiary sector that has to do with services. We also talked about the influences of resources and labor.
    00:06:59 We talked about comparative advantage and opportunity costs and how that influences specialization. Countries produce what they can produce best and most cheaply. And they import other things. So we're going to take a little break. And when we get back, we're going to talk more about the economic systems around the world and how that influences
    00:07:18 how goods are produced. So I'll see you in just a minute.

! Section 2

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi. My name is Kirsten and I'll be your instructor today. This lesson is Global Economic Sectors and Systems. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section, we'll be looking at the third objective, to identify the four main economic systems. Well, in our first section, we took a look at the different sectors of employment in economies.
    00:00:21 We saw how different types of jobs fall into different economic sectors. In this section, we're going to be taking a look at the most commonly found economic systems around the world. They are a traditional economy, a market economy, a planned economy, and a mixed economy. So we'll take a closer look at each of these in this section. So first let's start off with a traditional economy.
    00:00:45 Now, traditional economies still exist in many countries around the world, and it's based in culture. These are the indigenous economies that have existed for centuries, based on a native or original, natural methods of economy. If you think about the way economies typically operated for thousands and thousands of years, they were typically barter or trade systems. So people would produce something
    00:01:09 that they needed. They would trade it for something else, and that's how economies operated. And really, the invention of money as cash, that we trade things for money now, and that we use money to buy things, is a relatively new concept in human history. Actual money has really only been around, widespread, for the last couple of hundred years.
    00:01:30 Although actual coins have been around for thousands of years, that's not how most trade was done. Most trade was simply, I have something you want. You have something I want. Let's make a deal. Whereas today, throughout much of the world, we don't trade at all anymore. We typically just use money.
    00:01:48 But throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa, in South Asia, and other parts of the world, a traditional economy is still the most prevalent form of economy. People still barter and trade the way that they have done for generations. Next let's take a look at a market economy. In a market economy, economic decisions and pricing are established by businesses and citizens.
    00:02:13 So I'm producing something. I can charge whatever I want. And if I charge too much, people won't buy it. And if people buy it too quickly, then I know I need to charge a little bit more. And there's little government intervention, maybe only moderately as needed. And really, market economies in their true form don't exist
    00:02:32 anymore, because now there is government intervention. For example, although the United States would have a market economy, we really have what's called a mixed economy. And we'll look at that in a couple slides. Because our government does intervene. Our government does regulate businesses, regulate safety standards. It sets a minimum wage.
    00:02:53 They eliminate unfair business practices. Companies allowed to have monopolies, for example. The government sometimes invests in the economy when the economy is down, and they help save industries. In 2009, for example, when the automobile industry in America was going under, the United States provided loans to those car companies, helped them get back on their feet, and the like.
    00:03:12 So a market economy in its truest, truest form doesn't really exist anymore. Most countries that we think of as market economies actually have what's called a mixed economy. And we'll take a look at that in just a second. But in general, a market economy means supply and demand. Market forces of supply and demand
    00:03:30 dictate economic activity. When there's a lot of supply, prices go down. When there's not enough supply, prices go up. And it's the same thing with skills. If you have skills that are highly in demand, that require a great deal of education or talent. You can charge more for your skills than someone whose skills are more readily available throughout the
    00:03:50 population. So we'll take a look at a mixed economy here in just a moment. But first let's take a look at something called a planned economy. This, too, is falling out of favor very quickly. In a planned economy, the state manages the economy. They determine production.
    00:04:08 The government tells your factory what to produce, how much it's expected to produce, and then the government provides wages for everyone based on production. The problem with this type of situation is that there is no incentive. Everyone gets paid the same for doing the same job, whether they do it well, or they don't do it well at all. And countries that employed command economies, like the
    00:04:32 Soviet Union, like China did for many, many years, found that the quality of goods was not what should have been. Production was much lower than it would have been. And so this type of economy is being abandoned around the world. Now a planned economy is sometimes called a command economy. And again, a true planned economy doesn't really exist
    00:04:53 anymore, either. Because even though, yes, the government may direct a lot of production, there is still some privatization. And that's basically what China has done. They had a command economy for very long time that did not work, and so they started implementing more and more privatization as time went on. So today Cuba and North Korea and Iran
    00:05:16 have command economies. But again, the amount of planned economy and the amount of privatization varies from country to country. The Soviet Union did as well, until its collapse, and now the former countries that made up the Soviet Union all have some form of mixed economy. So let's take a look at a mixed economy. And again, this is what most countries of
    00:05:37 the world now employ. Again, a true command economy and a true market economy really don't exist too much. Instead, most countries have mixed economies. Now, the amount of planning by the government is going to vary. So you have a really wide spectrum in mixed economies, as well.
    00:05:54 You have the United States at one end, where the government provides very little intervention, very little government ownership of anything, compared to the other end, where there's a lot of government planning and a lot of government ownership. So again, a mixed economy means that an economy has elements of both a market and planned economy. Business ownership is privatized, but the government
    00:06:18 may run some public services, public works, public infrastructure, and the like. So some companies, for example have nationalized resources. So for example, the government owns all the oil fields and all the mining fields. That's not true here in the United States, but that is true of other mixed economies. In the United States, for example, the government runs
    00:06:37 the post office, so mail is government-owned. The United States government subsidizes Amtrak, our train system, whereas in other countries, all of the train systems, all of the mail, everything transportation-wise is subsidized by the government. We see this throughout Europe. That keeps costs low, and it encourages people to take public transportation because it's very cheap and
    00:07:00 affordable. So again, you see a wide spectrum of mixed economies as well. Just how much is the government involved in processes, and how much is the government hands-off? And again, the United States, our government is pretty hands-off. Occasionally, during economic crisis, our government might
    00:07:16 use more of these techniques to get our economy going. In wartime, for example, our government stepped in and set production quotas and the like for war. But in general, our government is pretty hands-off. That's very different from other countries around the world, where the government is much more involved in the economy, much more involved in telling companies what to do and the like.
    00:07:40 So again mixed ecomomies, really, free market and planned economies are the extremes. Most European countries, the United States, and Canada actually have what are called mixed economies. And again, we have government-provided fire, police, education and health care. We have government-provided public services and work programs. We still have privatization of businesses,
    00:08:03 but we do have some government public-run services. Everything from transportation services, our government, for example, runs all our airports, even though the airlines are privately owned. So government involvement is going to vary from country to country. And again, it really just depends on the situation. So there's a wide variety in mixed economies.
    00:08:23 Occasionally, the state may become a shareholder in private businesses. That's happened in American history before, but again, it's not common in American history, either. So when you look at country to country, you may hear the term, we have market economies, and we do. But understand that we really have a mixed economy. OK.
    00:08:41 So in review, we talked about the economic systems that exist around the world. And we talked, there's really no such thing as a completely free market economy, nor a completely free planned economy anymore. Most countries that have market economies really have mixed economies, and most countries that have planned economies have really started to abandon them, just because
    00:09:04 production is lower, economic growth is lower, and wealth is lower, and they've really started implementing various amounts of privatization of business in order to help their economy grow. So most people today live in a country with a mixed economy. However, there are still large amounts of traditional economies around the world, where most people get goods and services by bartering, rather than by getting a job,
    00:09:28 earning cash, and then using that cash to purchase goods. So thank you very much, and I'll see you next time. Bye.

! Section 3

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi, my name is Kirsten and I'll be your instructor today. This lesson is Global Economic Sectors and Systems. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section, we'll be looking at the fourth objective: to compare the roles of formal and informal sectors in relation to a country's economy. Well, in this section we're going to be taking a look at
    00:00:22 formal and informal sectors of employment. And we see the same kind of job being done here, but in two different sectors. First, on the left, we have someone who's likely doing this in the informal sector. This is someone taking care of a lawn. Perhaps they're taking care of their their own lawn, or maybe a neighbor's lawn.
    00:00:41 And chances are, when their work is done, they're going to be paid in cash. And this is part of the informal economy. Whereas the picture on the right, we see people part of a landscaping crew, doing almost the same job. But there's several people in the business. You can see, they all have hearing protection on. So they are being regulated in some way by the requirements
    00:01:01 of our government. Likely they're going to get a paycheck. They're going to have taxes taken out of their paycheck. They might even be provided with some benefits, like retirement benefits, or health care benefits, and the like. So this type of employment, instead, is called the formal sector, because the government regulates the sector. The government has laws with regard to safety and how many
    00:01:24 hours you can work and the like. As opposed to, on the left, the informal sector. So we're going to be learning about formal and informal sectors of our economy. So first, what is the formal sector? Well, the formal sector are economic and social activities regulated by law and policy. So anytime you get a job at a place, and you get a paycheck,
    00:01:46 and you have your social security taxes withheld, and you have your federal and state income tax withheld, and your business can be inspected by health inspectors or OSHA inspectors who look out for safety and the like, you're working in the formal sector. However, it's likely, in your life, you've also worked in the informal sector of employment. This is employment, economic and social activity, taking
    00:02:10 place outside of government regulation. So if you've ever babysat for someone and been paid in cash, or if you've ever mowed your neighbor's lawn, or picked up some leaves, or something like that, you're working in the informal sector of the economy. So what are the qualities of the formal sector? This is taxed labor, which means that income taxes are taken out on both state and federal income taxes, if your
    00:02:34 state has state income taxes. Typically business taxes, the business that you work for, they also pay taxes. Mandatory participation in government programs, like Social Security and Medicare, for example. There are labor standards. For example, you have to be a certain age. You can only work certain hours per week without getting
    00:02:56 overtime, if you're an hourly employee. If you're a teenager and you're working at a fast food restaurant, you have to be done at a certain time at night. You can't work all night, because you're expected to go to school. And that varies from state to state. Some states it's midnight, some states it's 1:00 AM.
    00:03:13 But chances are, you can't, if you're 16 years old, close that restaurant at 4 o'clock in the morning. That would likely be against the law in most states. These labor standards are all kinds of laws and agreements preventing behavior by employers and employees. So again, we can't have discrimination. We can't have unsafe workplaces and the like. Worker documentation is required, which means you have
    00:03:39 to prove that you're a United States citizen, or that you are here legally, and you do have the right to work in this country, like with a green card or some other documentation. And there are minimum wages. The United States has the federal minimum wage limit. Some states' minimum wages are even higher. So your employer can't pay you $2 an hour.
    00:03:58 That's against the law in every state. You are required to pay at least the federal minimum wage law. And again, state minimum wages might even be higher. Now, what are the qualities of the informal sector? Well, this can include both legal and illegal work. Black market and the trade of illegal goods falls into the informal sector.
    00:04:19 So for example, drug deals and anything else like that would fall under the informal sector because it's not regulated at all. This includes legal businesses avoiding regulation. So for example, if you do have a legal business, and then you hire undocumented workers, and you pay them cash under the table, that's against the law. But for our purposes here, it's also part of the informal
    00:04:43 sector of our economy. Again, there's no regulation, no way to oversee labor. There's no way to make sure that those undocumented workers are being treated fairly, that they're not being overworked, or they're not working in unsafe conditions. There's no way to track drug sales in this country, and take our taxes out of illegal drug sales, or anything like that.
    00:05:04 So again, legal and illegal work that is unregulated by the government, the government doesn't get its share of income tax or anything else. And again, it can be legal, or it might be illegal. It just depends. And this includes paid and unpaid work. So cash payments without documentation,
    00:05:21 for example, there's no receipts. And child care is something that's come under attack lately in recent years. If you full-time child care, nannies, for example, you have to file that paperwork with the government. You have to take out social security taxes and the like. You can't just pay someone under the table always. If you're running a child care business out of your house,
    00:05:44 you have to file taxes. You have to show what your income was and the like. This can include things like bartering. So this would ever happen if, let's say, I'll mow your lawn, and you paint my house. We're bartering services to each other. That includes the informal sector. Labor for family or friends.
    00:06:02 So again, if you go out and you mow the grass for your mom, and she pays you $20, of course that's legal. But again, that's part of the informal sector. And labor under coercion, of course, is not legal. So this would include illegal slavery, illegal sweatshops, things like that, where undocumented workers are smuggled into a country and then forced to work in factories, are forced into prostitution or
    00:06:27 something like that. That is also part of the informal sector. So again, it's important to note, it's not always illegal, but it often is illegal. OK. So let's talk about who is working in the informal sector. Throughout much of the world, it is women.
    00:06:42 Women make up a huge percentage of people working in the informal sector, especially around the world. Not so much here in America, but especially in places in Asia and Africa. So for example, women that take reeds and make baskets and sell them in the marketplace, they are involved in the informal sector. Often women are forced into these positions because of
    00:07:05 discrimination or culture prevents them from getting formal work. They may be, again, employed informally more often in other countries, and often more than men in other countries. So what we see in some countries is that women make up a much larger percentage of the informal sector than men do. And as a result, they often get much lower pay.
    00:07:27 Often the work is more dangerous. And again, they're not getting the benefit of government regulation. Children and the elderly also often work in the informal sector. Discrimination or labor laws prevent formal work. So for example, you want a job, but you're not old enough to get a job in your state yet, so you mow lawns for $40
    00:07:46 a lawn, because you can't go work at a fast food restaurant, or you can't go work at the record store, or something like that. Desire or need to assist families. So often people who stay home, for example, a mom that stays home is working in the informal sector. She's working plenty and she's not really getting paid cash. Or perhaps you're an elderly person, and discrimination
    00:08:10 doesn't allow you to go get a job. Because you're older, you might do something informally in order to get extra money and the like. And then finally, undocumented workers or unemployed workers. Often, unemployed workers are unable to find formal paid work elsewhere. And the other issue is they often try to get paid cash under the table for the jobs that they do do, because they
    00:08:35 don't want to lose unemployment benefits. Because, of course, your unemployment benefits aren't going to likely match what you were making in your regular job, and so you try to supplement that with a cash job or two. Also ineligible for formal worker compensation. So this would include undocumented workers who are here in this country illegally.
    00:08:54 They often are employed and paid in cash. That's the only way. So there's no record that they are working here illegally. And this also includes things like temporary or seasonal work. So for example, anytime you're engaged in summer babysitting or anything like that, that's seasonal. You don't do it year round.
    00:09:12 You only do it part of the year. Anything like that. So let's talk about, where does informal labor take place? And again, informal labor is anyone who's working in the informal sector. Someone getting paid cash, someone getting paid but not getting any of the benefits of government regulation.
    00:09:30 So no minimum wages, no safety standards and the like. Well, it's part of the economy in every country, even here in the United States. I think we documented that pretty well. But again, it is more common in developing and underdeveloped countries, and it may make up more than three fourths of the labor in Sub-Saharan African countries. So again, that is another challenge that Sub-Saharan
    00:09:51 Africa is facing. When these people are working in the informal sector, of course, they're not paying taxes, so that's less money for their government. They're not being protected. They're not making minimum wages. And it's very difficult to help our economies grow when we have this kind of economy existing.
    00:10:08 It may make up more than half of all labor in Latin American countries. So that would include countries in Central and South America. Very difficult for governments to regulate, track, and the like. It's difficult for governments to know exactly how much is being made in the informal sector, because of course,
    00:10:24 that's the whole point. You don't really want your government to know how much you're making. So it's very difficult to track statistics. One reason is because, of course, the temporary nature of the work. It's often seasonal. It's often very, very short term, and then it goes away.
    00:10:38 So that's one thing. And also, the hidden work. Anytime anything is being done illegally, you don't want the government to know. So you can't track black markets or culturally unacceptable work, like prostitution, for example. Because again, that's the whole idea, is you don't want people to know that you're earning money for
    00:10:56 this kind of work. So in review, we talked about the qualities of formal sectors. This is taxed and regulated work. This is work that has minimum wages. This is work where you receive an actual check, and you've had taxes taken out of it. This includes businesses that are regulated by the
    00:11:14 government, safety standards, and the like. And then we talked about informal sectors. Typically laborers may be women, the elderly, children, the undocumented, and the unemployed. So these are typically people who simply can't find employment in the formal sector. It's part of the economy in every country, including ours. Every time you babysit for $3 an hour, every time you mow a
    00:11:36 lawn, or whatever it is that you do to get extra income, you're part of the informal sector if you are being paid in cash. And then finally, it's very difficult for governments to track and monitor this sector, so we don't really know how much is generated. We can only guess about how much money in our country, for example, that's generated in the informal sector, just as
    00:11:57 countries around the world have the same issues that we do. So in review, in this lesson, we talked about our economies. We talked about the economic systems that are seen around the world, and we talked about here in the United States. We have a mixed economy. And we also talked about the various sectors of employment around the world, and how it's very different
    00:12:16 from country to country. Some countries may have most of their employment in primary economic activities, like agriculture, farming, ranching, and mining, and the like, and how some countries have most of their economic activities in secondary and tertiary activities. Secondary activities being manufacturing and turning those raw materials into other items, and then finally
    00:12:39 tertiary activities, which are the service industries. So I'd like you to think about your community. What are the types of jobs in your community? Do you live in an agricultural community, and most jobs tend to be in the primary sector? Or do you live in an industrial town, where most jobs might be in manufacturing and the secondary sector? Or maybe you live in a community where most jobs are
    00:13:01 in technology, and so most of the jobs in your area are in the tertiary sector? I'd also like you to think about the job that you'd like to have in the future. What kind of careers or positions are you interested in pursuing, and where do they fall within those economic sectors? So thank you very much, and I'll see you next time.
    00:13:19 Bye.
