KIRSTIN: Hi, my name is Kirstin and I'm your instructor today. Well, have you ever had someone stop and ask you for directions? Well, let's say someone asked you for directions to a nearby landmark, perhaps a shopping mall. How would you give those directions? Would you give them the latitude and longitude of that
00:00:18
shopping mall, or would you use nearby street names? Or perhaps, landmarks to help guide the person to the place where they wanted to arrive. And how would you describe that shopping mall? Might you list the stores that could be found there? Or things that you like about it. Or perhaps you might mention that it has movie theaters. Whenever you describe a particular landmark or area,
00:00:38
you're doing the same things that geographers do as they study the various regions around the globe. And in this lesson, we're going to take a look at some of the ways geographers study the different areas around the world. This lesson is Geographic Concepts. Our objectives: To examine the five themes of geography.
00:00:55
And to identify the six essential elements of geography. In our first section, we'll be looking at the first objective, and as we go along, some of our words and terms will be highlighted in purple. Pay close attention because these are part of your vocabulary for this lesson. So let's get started.
00:01:09
In our first section, we're going to be looking at the five themes of geography. This is simply a way for geographers to divide the study of a particular area or landmark into things that makes sense. So geographers might study a particular landmark's location, place, human/environment interaction, movement, or region.
00:01:31
And in this first section, we're going to be looking at our first two themes, {{location and place||hl1}}. So we'll be studying, what kind of things would geographers looking for in a particular area if they're looking at these two themes? So let's start with location. Let's say that you wanted to describe the location of a landmark like the White House.
00:01:50
Well, there are two ways you can do that. The first is an absolute location. You could give the exact address of the White House, or you could actually give its latitude and longitude, its geographic coordinate. The other way that you might describe the location of the White House is a relative location. Where is the White House in relation to other
00:02:10
landmarks in the area? So let's take a look at absolute location first. Absolute location is an exact location. And in the case of the White House, the latitude and longitude, the geographic coordinates of the White House, are 38 degrees North, 77 degrees West longitude. We also know the exact address of the White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC.
00:02:34
So let's take a look at the absolute location of the White House on this map. Well, like we said, the White House is located at 38 degrees North latitude and 77 degrees West longitude at this particular location. But of course, it's very difficult to give someone the latitude and longitude of a particular landmark for them to find it.
00:02:58
Sometimes relative location is easier to use. Relative location gives location in relation to something else. So, for example, the White House is located across the street from Lafayette Park. So let's take a look at the map of the White House area. And you can see the White House here. Here's Lafayette Park.
00:03:18
So you can see the White House is located across the street from Lafayette Park, and you would have to cross Pennsylvania Avenue. Or you could also say here that the White House is located next to the Eisenhower building, or East of the Eisenhower building. You can see the Eisenhower building there on the left. Next, let's take a look at the second of our
00:03:41
five themes, place. Now, whenever we're studying a particular city, or country, or area, sometimes it can help people understand what life is like there by describing place-- the distinguishing human and physical characteristics of a certain area. So by studying place, we can tell what this area is like. And these would be the most common ways you would describe
00:04:04
an area to someone else if you wanted them to understand what life was like there. So let's take a look at the ways that we can describe place. The first is landforms. For example, can you imagine discussing the Grand Canyon area without actually mentioning the Grand Canyon? You might also mention if an area is mountainous, or
00:04:23
perhaps it's hilly, or perhaps it's flat. Whenever you describe landforms, you are describing place. Next, we have climate. Here we see a picture of the Seychelles Islands. And of course, that's a tropical climate. Can you imagine describing Phoenix, Arizona, without maintaining that Phoenix is located in an arid desert?
00:04:43
That it's very hot and dry there during the summer. So climate is another great indicator of what characteristics a place has. Next, let's take a look at plant and animal life. Australia, for example, is known for its unusual wildlife. Things like kangaroos are located in Australia. Or perhaps, Sequoia National Park in California.
00:05:05
You might mention the giant redwood Sequoia trees in that particular park. Next, we have economic activity. In certain location, a certain economic activity is very important. So maple syrup, for example, comes from Vermont. So whenever you're describing the characteristics of Vermont, you're always going to mention the economic
00:05:27
activities. Think about Detroit, Michigan. What is Detroit, Michigan known for? Well, you probably know it's known for the auto industry. The American auto industry is based out of the city of Detroit. So if you want to describe the characteristics of that city, you might include that information as well.
00:05:44
Next, we have architecture. Some places, locations, or cities, or countries around the world have very distinct architecture. Paris is a great example. If you've ever visited Paris or seen photos of Paris, you know that the architecture is very, very unique. All of the buildings look very similar in the downtown area where all of the famous landmarks like Notre Dame
00:06:08
cathedral are. Of course, Paris is known for the Eiffel Tower pictured here. So whenever we describe Paris to someone who's never been there, it's likely we would mention the architecture. And finally, culture. Whenever we describe certain places, sometimes we mention culture.
00:06:28
Here we have in Northern Canada, Inuit, an ethnic group, lives in this area. And traditionally, they built igloos, and you can see this here. We might also mention that today, many Inuit still follow traditional ways of life. So perhaps they still hunt and they still wear distinctive clothing like you see in this photo.
00:06:50
So in review, we talked in this section about the first two of our five themes, location and place. We're going to take a little break. When we get back, we'll look at the remaining three themes of geography. So hang on, I'll see you in just a minute.

! Section 2
00:00:01
KIRSTEN: Hi. My name is Kirsten, and I'll be your instructor today. In this section, we will be continuing our study of geographic concepts. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section, we'll be looking at the first objective to examine the five themes of geography. Remember, the five themes of geography are simply a way of
00:00:20
organizing the study of geography. And in the first section, we talked about location and place. In this section, we will be looking at the final three themes, {{human environment interaction, movement, and region||hl1}}. Now, human environment interaction is one of the most important of the five themes, and it's the one we'll
00:00:40
probably spend the most time on. It is the relationship between people and their environment. How people have adapted to the environment, depended on, or modified their environment. So think about all of the activities we do every day. Everything from driving on a road that has altered the environment, to living in a house that has altered the environment, to drinking water from reservoirs, and
00:01:02
agriculture. Everything that humans do changes the planet. And of course, the planet is changing all the time, as well. So humans have to adapt to their environment as well. And this study is a very important concept that we will see throughout our study of geography. One way in which humans change the environment is by the way
00:01:24
we construct all the structures that we deal with on a daily basis. Everything from the types of homes and buildings we construct, to the economic activities we engage in, to transportation systems and communications systems. Everything that we do is changing or altering our environment. So take a look at this graphic.
00:01:42
You can see there's all different types of houses that you would find around the world. And many times, they are dependent totally on the environment. For example, the adobe structures of the old southwest, of course, were made out of adobe because there simply weren't any trees available. Many structures in Iceland are built into the ground in order
00:02:03
to protect people from the cold temperatures, just as in the Pacific region, many of the houses are built up off the ground in order to let breezes come through to protect you from warmer temperatures. Houses have to be constructed to withstand earthquakes and hurricanes and flooding, and all kinds of environmental hazards. So the environment greatly affects the type of housing
00:02:27
that we build all across the world. Another way that we change or modify our environment is by taking from the environment. This can be everything from mining, to agriculture, to industry, construction, and destruction. And this is one of the most profound effects that we can have on the environment. And of course, we receive many benefits.
00:02:49
Taking iron from the ground, we can turn that into steel and use it in skyscrapers and bridges. But there are also many negative effects, including pollution and climate change. Now, the next theme that we're going to look at in this lesson is movement. And movement is the travel of people, goods, and ideas from one location to another.
00:03:11
And this can happen many ways. People travel to new locations, we trade with one another, and people migrate from one place to another. Cultures can expand, such as the British Empire, which expanded into the New World. Or people can relocate, such as all the immigrants that came from Europe into this country. And whenever people move around or whenever goods are
00:03:32
transferred, the culture changes across the globe. And this is especially easy today, because transportation times have decreased so greatly, and we also have a technological advancements, like the telephone and the internet. And a great example to show you how something can change and move is pizza. It's probably one of your favorite foods, and pizza has
00:03:54
been around for very long time, since about 1000 AD. And when pizza was originally created, it was really just a dish for poor people. It was just a piece of flat bread that bakers would use to test the temperature of their ovens. Well, later they started adding toppings, things like cheese and olive oil. And actually, tomato sauce was not introduced onto pizza
00:04:16
until the 1600s, when tomatoes came from the Americas to Italy. Today, of course, pizza has come to America through Italian immigration, and pizza is popular all around the world. And many of the toppings vary from one region to another. While here in America one of our favorite toppings is pepperoni, it's very common to find corn on pizza in Asia.
00:04:40
Now, the next theme is region, and a region is an area on the Earth's surface that is defined by certain unifying characteristics. And regions are very rarely set and distinct. Many times, they're very fluid, and perception plays an important part of what exactly is a region. Now, one type of region is a formal region. This can be everything from the
00:05:04
European Union as a region. It can be the United States as a region. These have formal boundaries and formal political boundaries. The next type of region is a physical region, such as the American Midwest or the American South. Very fluid. What I might put into the American South, you not
00:05:24
necessarily would. But that's OK. It's just a way of grouping people together that share common cultural characteristics. A cultural region is another type of region. When you think about the Muslim world, for example, that's a great way of showing you how a culture can bind people together in a region.
00:05:42
And again, remember that regions are very, very fluid. Everyone feels differently about what constitutes a region, and that's OK, because it's all based on perception. I'm going to show you an example here about how a region can be fluid. And fluid means regions, and the ideas of regions, are always changing. So when we talk about the south during the Civil War
00:06:05
era, most people would put the states that seceded from the Union during the Civil War. And we would consider that to be the South. And you can see those marked on the map here. However, by the 1900s, people might feel differently about what states are in the South. We might have added a few states, like West Virginia and Oklahoma, into the South, but again, not everyone would
00:06:27
necessarily put those states in the South. Today, the South has an entirely different concept. Many people who think about the South think about the Old South. The old cotton growing areas of the United States. And so, they likely may exclude, for example, Florida. Or they might exclude Texas, which many people feel has its own region.
00:06:47
Someplace like Virginia, for example, people might consider the mid-Atlantic region. So regions, again, are very fluid. There is no right or wrong answer. Some people might put every state here into the South and some people might not. And that's perfectly fine. So in review, in this section we talked again about the five
00:07:07
themes of geography. We focused on the last three objectives, human environment interaction-- one of the most important geographic themes-- movement, as well as region. Thank you.

! Section 3
00:00:00
KIRSTEN: Hi, my name is Kirsten and I'll be your instructor. Today's lesson is titled Geographic Concepts. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section we'll be looking at the second objective, to identify the six essential element of geography. Well, remember there is more than one way to break up the study of geography.
00:00:23
And in this section we'll be looking at the six essential element of geography. It's simply a way of organizing our study of geography to help us focus on the most important aspects. {{The six elements of geography are the world in spatial terms, places and regions, physical systems, human systems, environment and society, and the uses of geography.||hl1}}
00:00:47
Now remember earlier in this lesson we looked at the five themes of geography. And many of the same ideas and concepts overlap between these two methods. And it doesn't mean that you'll never use the five themes or you'll never use the six essential elements. Chances are you're going to use both types of organization throughout your study of geography.
00:01:07
Now the first of the six essential themes is the world in spatial terms. This is simply to organizing the world in a spatial context. Trying to determine what location has to do with other elements of geography. How is one region related spatially to another? What types of landforms are near each other? And so forth.
00:01:29
And we use many different tools to help us in organizing the world in this way, including maps, satellite images, and photographs. And we use these tools to analyze the relationship between people and environments. Now the second theme is places and regions. Now this includes the physical and human characteristics of a place, as well as the regions that are created to help us
00:01:53
organize and interpret the Earth's physical and cultural similarities and differences. And by using both place and region in our study of geography, we're better able to identify characteristics that places have in common in a certain region, as well as characteristics that make them different. A great example we can look at here. Take a look at this map of the United States, and what would
00:02:18
you call this particular region? Well, many of you might identify this as the American southwest. Now when I ask to identify the American southwest, you'll likely say Arizona and New Mexico and maybe parts of other states like Texas and Nevada. So what I'm going to ask you to do now is think of things that you might use to describe the American southwest. So take a moment and think of a couple things.
00:02:43
When you think of the American southwest, how would you describe it to someone else? Well, you might say something like the plant life. It's full of cactus. Or the economic activity that people engage in, such as ranching. You might also mention its climate. It has a very arid desert.
00:02:59
And all of these things would be correct. Well, let's take a look at another region. This particular region. What is the name that you would use to call this region of the United States? Well, you might say New England or you might say the northeast. And both of these labels would be correct. Now again I'm going to ask you to take a moment and think
00:03:21
about how you would describe New England to people that have never been there. What kind of things would you use to describe this particular region? Well, again there are many correct answers. You might mention the foods people eat in New England such as lobster or clam chowder. Or you might mention the architecture, such as this
00:03:41
lighthouse. You might mention the climate there. In the fall the leaves change color. And again so by identifying characteristics in a particular region, we learn more about that particular place. Now the next essential element we'll be discussing is physical systems. The physical processes that have shaped and
00:04:01
continue to shape the Earth. The Earth is always changing. We are always adapting to the different changes that the Earth gives us. And this can include everything from climate, to weather, ecosystems, the plant and animal life in a particular area, erosion-- this is the way the weather changes the Earth's surface
00:04:21
through wind, such as a hurricane coming through and picking up all the sand off a beach. Plate tectonics-- this is the way the plates in the Earth's crust are continually moving and changing. The water cycle or oceans and how they are always changing the Earth. The next essential theme of the geography, essential
00:04:44
element, excuse me, is human systems. And human systems include things like population, culture, settlement, and relationships. All the different systems that humans have created from social systems to political systems and economic systems. This can include things like a migration, how people move from one place to another. The distribution of people across the planet's surface.
00:05:08
Interdependence, how we work together to solve problems, and cooperation, and conflict. The next essential element is the environment and society. This includes the study of the ways people have adjusted to and altered their environment. And if this sounds a lot like one of the five themes of geography, you'd be correct. Because remember this is essentially the same as
00:05:31
human/environment interaction, which is one of our five themes. So people, again, are changing the environment all the time, and the environment and society element helps us study the way that people adjust to environmental change, how we adapt to our environment, and the way we adapt the environment to suit our needs. So people have both benefited from and destroyed natural
00:05:53
resources, for example. So how we use our resources, how we use agriculture, how we use our mining resources, and how we change that environment in return, such as the landfill. You understand that we're studying all types of human environmental interactions. The final six of the six elements is the uses at geography.
00:06:16
And geography allows us to interpret the past, to understand the present, and to plan for the future. So we use geography all the time in the big decisions that we're making as a society. For example, we all understand that our resources are precious so we need to do things like recycle and compost and more and more Americans are taking that attitude.
00:06:36
Another great way that we can use geography is imagine the old family car. This car back from the 50s, it was a great car but it had one big problem. It caused pollution. And we've really seen the effects of pollution across this country. So what we've done instead, is we've invented new kinds of
00:06:52
cars that pollute less such as this hybrid. Not only does it pollute less, it also uses less gasoline. And we understand that oil is a very precious resource. So what other kinds of changes might we see in the future? More public transportation, more high rises as our population grows. And geography helps us make these decisions that we're going to have to make in the future as our human population
00:07:18
grows, as our resources become more precious. And we have big decisions to make as a society as a result. So let's take a look and compare the six elements and the five themes. So first, our first of the six elements is the world in spatial terms. This is very similar to the five themes' elements of location, place, and regions. The second essential element is places and regions.
00:07:45
We would study very similar types of content in place and regions under the five themes. Now remember we discussed environment and society. It bears a great deal of resemblance to human/environment interaction in the five themes. Human systems in the six elements. We would study the same type of content that we would study in human environment interaction and movement.
00:08:11
Physical systems in the six elements. Many of the same concepts would be discovered in place, human/environment interaction, and regions. And finally, uses of geography is a brand new element. There's not really a type of a theme that shows an exact correlation. But of course you would probably also discuss ways to use geography when you use the five themes to break up your
00:08:36
geographic studies. So again, in this lesson we learned about the six elements and the five themes. Again the six elements world in spatial terms, places and regions, physical systems, human systems, environment and society, and uses of geography. And the five themes, location, place, human/environment interaction, movement, and regions.
00:09:00
And again, remember all the five themes are and the six elements are are ways of breaking up the study of geography. And of course there's no right or wrong way. The five themes have been around a very long time. It's a very traditional method of studying geography. But more and more teachers in schools are moving towards the six elements of geography.
00:09:21
So let's review what we talked about in this section. We talked, again, about the six essential elements. The world in spatial terms. Being able to determine location. Places and regions. The human and physical characteristics of a region or place. Physical systems, including the way the
00:09:38
Earth is always changing. Things like climate and weather and erosion. Human systems. This includes the government, movement of people, society, culture, everything that we as humans have created. Environment and society. The way we interact and adapt to our environment. And the used of geography.
00:09:57
Why we study geography, the tools that we use in the importance that geography plays in our daily lives. So in this lesson we learned all about describing a place. So think about the places you visit. How would you describe it to someone who had never been there? Would you talk about climate? Would you talk about the types of things that
00:10:17
you could do there? Would you talk about the population size? Is it crowded or is it wide open like a rural area? We can use many, many ways to describe a particular place or region. And using our six essential element and five themes helps us address all of the different ways that people have changed a place in which they inhabit.
00:10:38
So it's been great talking to this lesson, and I'll see you next time. Bye.
