! Section 1
00:00:01
TEACHER: Hi. My name is Kirsten. And I'm your instructor today. Well, take a look at the pictures taken in cities around the world. We can see they don't look exactly the same. They have different types of architecture, different types of geography, and likely their population is
00:00:15
different as well. Well, how do we compare cities to one another? What names do we use? And how do we compare them? What are the basis for which that we do that? Well, we can compare it by population. We can compare it in the way it develops. And in this lesson, we're going to take a look at the
00:00:31
ways geographers use to compare cities or settlements to each other. This lesson is Comparative Urban Environments. Our objectives, to compare levels of modern urban development, to explore the development and growth of modern urban areas, and to compare and contrast influences on the development of diverse urban environments. In this section, we'll be looking
00:00:53
at our first objective. And as we go along, we'll be taking a look at words and terms that are highlighted in purple. Pay close attention. Because those are part of your vocabulary for this lesson. So let's get started. How do we rank human settlements? How do we compare them to each other?
00:01:09
Well, there's two ways, generally, that geographers do that. The first is by population. How many people live together in this settlement? And how did government use, what terms do they use to classify these settlements? The second way that we compare settlements is by their impact.
00:01:26
So how important is this particular settlement to the region or to the country? And how does this particular settlement affect its neighbors? So in this section, we're going to be taking a look at these issues. Primarily, we're going to be focusing on population. So let's take a look.
00:01:41
What are the terms we use to give settlements of people based on their population? Well, the interesting thing is there's no one way that we do this. Around the world, people use different terms for different size settlements. So perhaps you may have heard the term village before. Well, that's not typically a term you're going to hear much
00:02:00
here in the United States, unless maybe you're in New England. It's far more common to hear the term village in England, for example. So what exactly is the village? Well, a village is a small community of dozens or hundreds of residents. Typically, they have small municipal governments.
00:02:16
And municipal's a word we use for cities. So a city government. And typically, villages are located in rural areas. Well, in another part of the United States, you might live in a small community with dozens or hundreds of residents. And instead, you call it a town. The term town can be many different things in many
00:02:35
different parts of the world. These are typically larger communities of hundreds or thousands of residents. It typically serves a larger region and provides basic services for residence. So maybe a lawyer's office, a hospital, maybe more services than you would get in a village. Now, another word that can mean many different things,
00:02:55
depending upon where you live, is a city. And again, what might only be considered a town here in the United States might be a city in a country with a much smaller population. In England, for example, a city is any settlement that has a cathedral. And no matter how many people live there, that's considered a city.
00:03:13
So again, this term means something different, depending upon where you are. But in general, a small city has tens or hundreds of thousands of residents. Typically, they're centers for regional trade. And you will likely have more services. You might have more theaters, more culture, maybe a museum or two, maybe more than one hospital, more services for
00:03:35
the residents, as well a larger population. Next, then we have large cities. And in this country, we tend to call them metropolises. They have millions of residents. And metropolitan areas include cities and their suburbs. So if we just look at the city population itself, it doesn't give us a very good picture. Let's take Dallas, for example.
00:03:55
Dallas is a city. But whenever we talk about Dallas, we're not just talking about Dallas. We're typically, also talking about Fort Worth and all the cities and towns between those two cities, places like Irving or Arlington where the Dallas Cowboys play, for example. So metropolises are the metropolitan areas that include not only the city but all of the surrounding cities
00:04:18
and suburbs that make up that geographic area. Next, we have the largest settlements in the world. These are called megacities. Megacities have above 10 million inhabitants. There's only about 20 of them. They connect their countries and regions to the world economy. And these are the world's largest cities.
00:04:41
You'll also sometimes hear the term conurbation. A conurbation is an agglomeration of multiple cities. So an agglomeration means that these cities have sprawled towards each other, lots and lots of suburbs and little settlements in between. And it seems like one big giant city. And a great example of this could be from Boston,
00:05:02
Massachusetts down to Washington, D.C., if you were to get in your car and drive, it would seem like you were in cities the whole time. Because you have multiple cities that have just grown towards each other. You have Washington, D.C., you have Baltimore, Maryland. You have Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New York City, Hartford, Connecticut, and on to Boston,
00:05:22
Providence, Rhode Island. All of those cities have grown together, making it seem like one giant long city. Sometimes you'll also hear the term megalopolis for this particular type of settlement. So let's take a look at the megacities. We're going to look at the 20 largest megacities, as of 2010.
00:05:42
You can see you have New York, Los Angeles, and Mexico City here in North America. Each of the cities has a population exceeding 10 million people. Then, in South America, you have Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paolo, and Buenos Aires. In Africa, you have Lagos and Cairo. In the Eurasia region, you have Moscow and Istanbul.
00:06:03
And then, look here in South Asia, you have several, including Delhi, Karachi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Dhaka. And in East Asia, we have Tokyo and Osaka in Japan, Beijing and Shanghai in China, as well as Manila in the Philippines. So next, we're going to take a look at the way cities develop and influence a region. Well, how many larger or smaller
00:06:28
settlements fill a region? Well, settlements often follow a predictable pattern. Typically, a country or region will have fewer large settlements and many, many, many smaller settlements. And they usually follow a mathematical population pattern. So for example, if the largest city in a region has one million residents, the second largest city in the region
00:06:50
will likely be about half that size, in this case 500,000 residents. The third largest city will likely be a third the size of the largest city. And then, that number just continues to grow and grow and grow smaller and smaller and smaller, that same pattern. And what else we'll see is that we'll have one big city of a million people.
00:07:13
And then, we'll have a couple of cities at the 500,000 level and a couple at the 333,000 level and so on and so on. Only we get more and more and more the smaller we get. So let's take an example of how this has occurred. We're going to be looking at Australia. These are pictures of Australia's two largest cities. On the left, we have Sydney.
00:07:34
And on the right, we have Melbourne. So if we look at the largest cities in Australia, based on population, we've plotted out number 1 through 50 based on population size. And you can see we have Sydney and Melbourne here. So only have a couple with millions of residents. Then, we have a few larger cities with maybe a million to two million residents.
00:07:55
And then, we have lots and lots of small cities. And we see this pattern over and over and over in region after region around the world. OK. So in review, ranking human settlements by population is something that geographers do. We have small settlements, which includes villages or towns.
00:08:16
We have a large settlements, which include cities metropolises. And we know that population size, based on settlement, is going to follow this mathematical pattern. Rank, size, distribution. We have many, many smaller cities, and a few larger cities. And we saw that, when we plot them on a plot, we're going to
00:08:39
get that rank-size curve that we saw when we looked at Australia. So hang on. We're going to take a little break. And when we get back, we're going to talk about how urban areas develop and grow. So I'll see you in just a minute.

! Section 2
00:00:01
TEACHER: Hi, my name is Kirsten, and I'm your instructor today. This lesson is Comparative Urban Environments. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here. And in this section, we'll be looking at our second objective, to explore the development and growth of modern urban areas. Well, in this lesson, we've been looking at the ways that
00:00:19
geographers rank human settlements. And in our first section, we talked about how geographers rank based on population. They give names for settlements, a town, or village, or city, or megalopolis, based on population size. And we talked about the fact that these terms don't necessarily mean the same thing from region to region or
00:00:39
from country to country. Well, in this section, we're going to be taking a look at ranking settlement size based on impact. So how important is a settlement to the region? And how does the settlement affect its neighbors? So now we're looking at how influential a settlement is, does it influence the economy, does it influence culture, and so forth.
00:01:02
So in addition, we're not so focused on how big it is based on population. Instead, we're looking at importance. How important is this city to this area? So let's take a look at why some cities are larger and more influential than others. We can see, we have two very different things that we might see in a settlement.
00:01:23
On the left, we have a small gas station. On the right, we have a football team stadium. That's Cleveland Browns stadium. So would we see a professional football team stadium in a town of 10,000 people? Well, probably not. That town of 10,000 people doesn't need a professional football stadium, but we do see it in big cities like
00:01:43
Cleveland, and Dallas, and San Francisco, for example. So some cities are larger and more influential. And this goes back to Walter Christaller's Central Place Theory, and this says that the size and growth of a settlement is based upon the services it can offer. So some cities are going to grow, and as they grow, they're going to offer more services. And that's simply going to make them grow even more.
00:02:08
So there's really two kinds of services. There are low-order services. These are services that you need every day, and chances are, in most towns that you visit, you're going to find them. You're going to find a gas station. You're going to find a grocery store. You're going to find a department store, all together
00:02:25
kind of store, where you can buy things like paper towels, and a new bike, and toys, and all kinds of things like that. You're going to find maybe restaurants and the like, but maybe your selection is going to be limited. You'll probably find perhaps some place to get your car fixed if it breaks down. But what you are not going to find are things typically found only in larger settlements, and these are
00:02:47
called higher-order services. So these are more specialized items. You're likely not going to find a sports stadium in a small town. You're not going to find luxury items, such as high-end designer clothing, $500 shoes, and the like. Instead, you're only going to find things in small towns that can be supported, that people typically want on a daily basis.
00:03:09
But when you get to a larger settlement, you are going to find more specialized items. Because again, even though you're not using these every day, you're using them occasionally, there's a lot of people in that city using them occasionally. So let's take a look at how we rank settlements by impact. First, at the bottom, we have what are called lower-order settlements.
00:03:31
These are simply towns and other settlements that offer lower-order services. Next, we have a higher-order settlement, so we might find more kinds of things we want. We might find a sports stadium. We might find some theaters that show a play occasionally. We might find a store that sells fine wines and fine foods, like caviar and the like.
00:03:54
And then finally, at the very top of the food chain, we have what's called a primate city. This is a city that directs all of the other settlements in a huge region. This is the city that directs the economy, the most important city. It has the best universities, the best art, the best everything.
00:04:10
And so we're going to take a look at these three types of settlements. So first, let's take a look at lower-order settlements. Lower-order settlements provide lower-order services. So again, things people typically need every day. So we need gas, we need a grocery store, we need a small department store, where we can buy supplies that we need. We need a few restaurants, we need businesses that meet our
00:04:34
everyday needs. So we're likely going to find a doctor, we're going to find a dentist. We're going to have a government, we're going to have a police station and the like. So again, specialization is going to be low. So we're not going to find a wide variety. We're not going to find 50 doctors, but we'll probably find a couple of doctors.
00:04:51
In addition, lower-order settlements often provide goods and raw materials for larger cities. So in a rural area, for example, it might be a farming community. So a lot of people farm and provide those goods for a larger city. Typically, what happens is that they rely on higher-order settlements for special needs.
00:05:10
So occasionally, if you live in a lower-order settlement, let's say you get really sick, you get cancer. Well, your lower-order settlement probably doesn't have an oncologist, a doctor who treats cancer. So you're likely going to drive to the next type of settlement, a larger settlement, to meet that specialized need. Let's say you're looking for some
00:05:30
special kind of furniture. Well, you may not have a furniture store in a lower-order settlement. So you're going to have to drive to a bigger city in order to find a furniture store and the like. So let's take a look at higher-order settlements. So this is the next step on the food chain. So at the bottom, we have lower-order settlements, and
00:05:47
then we have higher-order settlements. They provide the lower- and higher-order services for citizens. So you're still going to find food stores, you're still going to find big box stores, you're still going to find restaurants. But you're likely going to find more of them, and you're also going to find higher-order services.
00:06:03
You're going to maybe have a professional sports stadium. You're going to have a theater that shows a play occasionally. You're going to have an art store. You're going to have other types of services that you don't typically find in a smaller-order settlement. So businesses can meet more obscure, specialty, or valuable needs.
00:06:20
So you're going to find more luxury items. You're going to find designer clothing that can cost thousands of dollars instead of off-the-rack clothing that you typically find in a lower-order settlement. In addition, we have high specialization in services. So you might find specialized banking services, you might find someone that can help you with your investments. You're going to find doctors who specialize in certain
00:06:43
types of treatment. You're going to find maybe dentists who specialize in periodontics, not just a regular dentist who cleans teeth, and fills cavities, and does everything. So again, more specialization, more obscure things can be bought here, and found here, and the like. And again, higher-order settlements typically rely on lower-order settlements for resources and raw materials.
00:07:07
So next, we're going to take a look at primate cities. So these are the cities at the top of the food chain. These are the cities that really direct everything going on in their region, so they are above a higher-order settlement. Now primate cities meet and manage all order of services in surrounding settlements, and they are typically the largest and most influential cities in their region.
00:07:29
So typically, they have the largest percentage of the population in the region. They are the center for government and services. Often, they are a capital city for a region. And they also create and establish their region's culture, and they connect their region to the world economy. So let's take a look at an example of a primate city, and
00:07:49
we'll take a look at why they are a primate city. So this is Dublin. The first thing that we notice that they had to have is a large percentage of the area's population. Well, take a look at this. Dublin's population is over a million people. And you can see, the next biggest city is Cork with only 200,000 people.
00:08:08
Let me highlight that for you. So you can see Dublin is many times bigger than Cork. So if you were to add all this population together, you'd find that Dublin has more people in it than even the rest of the population combined. So it's a very, very big, big city, and the majority of people that live in urban environments live in the city of Dublin rather than these other urban environments.
00:08:36
So let's take a look at Dublin. And again, now we're going to take a look at why Dublin is so influential. So again, it's the capital of Ireland. 40% of Ireland's population lives in the city of Dublin. So it's not quite half, but it's a huge percentage of Ireland's population. 42% of those working in Ireland work in Dublin.
00:09:00
And it produces almost half of Ireland's gross domestic product. So we see, it's very important Ireland's economy. It produces a great deal of goods and services produced in Ireland. 40% of people who work in Ireland work in Dublin. It also has the largest and busiest port. It's on the ocean.
00:09:20
It lies just across the Irish Sea from important ports in England, including Liverpool. So again, it's very important economically, as well as being a population center for this region. Next, we know it's also got to be influential with regards to culture and in other areas. So Dublin is the center of government and culture. It's the capital of Ireland, and it has its oldest and
00:09:44
largest universities. It has a beneficial location, it's located on the ocean. It has a deep water harbor, so it's the busiest port in Ireland. And again, it's adjacent to English ports. And by adjacent, we mean near or next to. It lies just across the Irish Sea from some of the most important ports in England.
00:10:02
And then also, it's the center for Irish trade. A majority of Ireland's employees in industry and services work in Dublin. And it also provides and manages high-order and low-order services in Ireland. So if we were to go visit one city in Ireland, this is the city we'd want to visit. This is the one that has the most culture, it has the most
00:10:23
things to do. It has the best economy, it has the most jobs. And you can see why this is considered a primate city. This is the most important city in this region when it comes to culture, when it comes to economy, and when it comes to population size. So in review, we talked about geographers rank settlements based on impact and services offered.
00:10:44
So now we're looking at which cities are most important in a region. And again, lower-order settlements, the ones at the bottom of the food chain, meet residents' immediate needs. Higher-order settlements meet immediate and more specialized needs. So again, as we move to a higher-order settlement, we're going to find more variety, we're going to find more
00:11:03
services, we're going to find more specialized services. And then finally, primate cities direct a region's government, culture, and economy. So thank you very much, and I'll see you next time. Bye.

Section 3
! 00:00:01
TEACHER: Hi. Welcome back. This lesson is Comparative Urban Environments. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here. And in this section, we'll be looking at our third objective, to compare and contrast influences on the development of diverse urban environments. Well, in this lesson, we've been talking about how we
00:00:17
compare cities to each other. We've talked about how we can compare them based on influence and population. And in this section, we're going to take a look at the way cities develop and what makes them develop so differently. There are many factors that can affect urban development. This includes colonization, rapid economic expansion,
00:00:36
historical influence, political ideology, or religious culture. So we're going to be taking a closer look at each of these factors in this section. So first, let's start with colonization. Well, colonial influence can commonly be seen in cities in South America, Africa, and Asia. Places where Europeans came in and colonized and took over
00:00:58
these particular cities. We can see that influence linger on today. One way we can see that is that many of these cities have international business districts. These areas were formerly the centers of colonial government and trade. And now, today, international businesses have come in and set up their headquarters in these regions of the cities.
00:01:17
We often also see architecture leftover from the colonizing culture. So many of the buildings may have European influences, rather than traditional African or Asian influences. Another thing that we can see in these city is a history of segregation. For example, international businesses might be located in one part of the city, while domestic business will be
00:01:40
located somewhere else. And we often see segregation between colonial and local cultures as well. Now, the next factor that can affect city development is rapid economic expansion. Whenever cities grow very, very quickly, that often encourages changes to city design and culture. Commonly, we see this in the rapidly growing areas of Asia,
00:02:03
South Asia, as well as Africa. These are the same cities that are undergoing rapid population growth. And as well, new migrants often come to these cities seeking jobs or other economic opportunities. And often, what happens is the growth outpaces the city's ability to keep up with it. So we start to see slum areas.
00:02:24
Because people are just pouring into cities faster than places can be built for them to live. We also start to see agglomerations of cities where cities are expanding so quickly that they're running into each other. Economic growth often encourages cities to sprawl together in this manner. Next, let's take a look at historical influences.
00:02:44
And there's a great couple of photos that I'd like you to take a second to look at here. Take a look at the city on the left and the size of that street. Well, you can tell this is a very, very old city. This is a city in Italy, Naples. And look how narrow the street is. It's obviously constructed well before anyone thought of
00:03:03
the automobile or a bus, for example. These types of cities are often built for walkers. And we see this very commonly in old, old cities. The other thing that we see is this city on the right. We have a big public square, a big opening. This is also something we see in older cities. So historical influence of ancient cultures on city design can still be seen today.
00:03:26
We commonly see these in the cities of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Most of the cities in the United States are too young for these types of developments. But maybe some of the things that we see here might apply to older cities in the New England area, like New York City, for example. Typically, these cities have very, very dense inner cities,
00:03:47
narrow walkways, narrow streets. Because they were designed and built for pedestrian traffic, rather than for public transportation or automobiles or airports or trains or anything like that. Typically, these cities often have an opposite type of neighborhood than we see here in America. In America, typically, the inner city is the poorer neighborhoods and the wealthy areas are in the suburbs.
00:04:09
Well, it's the exact opposite in some of these older cities. The wealthy wealthiest people live in the city center. And the suburbs tend to be poor. And the further you go out, the more poor those suburbs tend to get. So if you think about cities like London and Rome and Paris, these are the types of trends that you will see. Also, these cities typically have central gathering spaces,
00:04:32
bazaars, plazas, and parks. And they were often connected to the historical marketplace that existed hundreds and hundreds of years ago, such as the Greek agora or the Roman forum. Next, let's take a look at the effect of political ideology on city planning and construction. And a great way that we can take a look at this is in many of the old Soviet republic parts of Eastern Europe,
00:04:58
Russia today, for example. We see a very, very different type of architecture there than we see in Western Europe. Typically, these cities, because, again, of the style of government they had, the government buildings were the most ornate and beautiful. And we can see that here. While people tended to live in very
00:05:16
utilitarian types of housing. Prefabricated housing that all kind of looks the same. And you can see an example of this on the right. Look. Each and every one of those buildings is constructed in exactly the same manner. It probably has the exact same type of decor. And again, to make everyone appear to be equal.
00:05:34
So a great example of political ideology on city planning is the socialist influence on architecture and urban design, very commonly seen in Eastern Europe. Countries like Russia, Ukraine, Poland, the Czech Republic. Typically, these cities have ornate government and public buildings and more utilitarian types of private buildings and apartments.
00:05:57
And utilitarian means not very fancy. It's meant to be used and used well. And then, it's meant to hold up for a long time. And it's very plain. Typically, in these cities, they used prefabricated and mass-produced designs for housing and panel apartment blocks for their workers. So the city employees, the government employees worked in
00:06:18
these beautiful, beautiful ornate buildings. But everyone went home to these rather ordinary homes when the day was done. Now, another influence that we can see throughout many cities of the world is the influence of religious culture. Typically, many of these cities have a giant, huge, ornate, beautiful religious building, like we see here.
00:06:42
This is the cathedral in Mexico City. And again, this goes back to that historical influence of religion in those cities but can still be seen in cities around the world today, such as in Rome, the Vatican, the cities in the Middle East. So religion can also influence city design and culture, commonly seen in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East. Typically, these cities have
00:07:07
landmark religious buildings. Think about the city of London, St. Paul's Cathedral is on the top highest point of the city. It's beautiful. You can see it from around the city in many different places. Those religious buildings could be churches as well as temples or mosques. Typically, these cities also have religious gathering
00:07:27
places, squares, where people can go to hear a sermon, for example, or other religious speech. And often, they're at the city's highest point of elevation. Another good example of that is, in Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock is on the highest point in the city. That is a Muslim mosque. So in review, many factors can affect the way cities develop,
00:07:51
including colonization, which can lead to international business districts, economic expansion, which can result in rapid growth and difficult for cities to keep up. Historical influences can result in dense inner cities and central gathering spaces. Political ideology, we took a look at those old Soviet buildings that can heavily influence architecture. And of course, religious culture can still influence
00:08:16
city development today, central religious spaces and ornate religious building. So in this section, we learned all about the way we rank cities against each other, how we compare them, and also the ways in which cities develop. Not only the outside influences, but also how things affect other cities in their region. So I'd like you to take a minute and think about the
00:08:38
city in which you live. Where does your city or town fit on that rank? Do you live in a small town, or do you live in a big city, or even in a megalopolis? And I'd like you take a moment to think about how your city or settlement affects those around it. And maybe some of those factors, perhaps, that have affected the way your city has developed over time.
00:09:00
So thanks so much for your attention. And I'll see you next time. Bye.
