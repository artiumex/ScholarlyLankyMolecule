! Section 1

    00:00:00 TEACHER: Hi, I'm Jane, your instructor. It may be difficult for you to imagine that around the world over 69 million school-age children don't attend school, let alone finish primary school, or that almost 9 million children won't make it to their fifth birthday. They will die before that. However, these occurrences are extremely common in places like sub-Saharan Africa, where more than one half of
    00:00:22 school-age children are not attending school and where one in seven children will have died before their fifth birthday, or in Asia, where almost a quarter of school-age children do not attend primary school. While some countries enjoy a high standard of living, others do not. Disease, unstable governments, and other factors can influence a nation's ability to provide a high quality of
    00:00:45 life for its citizens. So in this lesson we're going to explore what the global community is doing to address the development issues and what some barriers to economic growth are. This lesson is Barriers to Economic Growth, and this is Section One. Our objectives are to identify the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals; examine geographic, social, and
    00:01:05 political characteristics of Least Developed Countries LDCs that inhibit economic growth; and to explore strategies implemented by governments and private corporations to overcome barriers to economic growth. Now in this section we're going to focus on the first objective: to identify United Nations' Millennium Development Goals.
    00:01:24 Here you see a picture of the former first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, and the president, Harry Truman, holding the flag of the United Nations. The United Nations is an international organization established in 1945, and Harry S Truman did send a representative of the United States to sign that to become a member nation. The member nations are dedicated to maintaining peace
    00:01:50 and security, to developing friendly relations between countries, and to improving standards of living. There were originally 51 member nations, of which the US was one, and today there are 193 member nations. The United Nations operates around the globe, addressing a number of issues, and they have various councils and committees to do this. Some of the issues that they tackle are things like social
    00:02:13 development, disaster relief, improving food production, environmental concerns, and health issues. The Millennium Development Goals were established at the Millennium Summit, which was a meeting of the world leaders that took place in 2000 in New York. And here is the UN headquarters in New York City. This is where the Millennium Development Goals were established.
    00:02:38 These are eight goals to improve the condition of people living in Least Developed Countries, these LDCs. And they have a target achievement date of 2015. So by 2015 they want to significantly improve the condition of people living in Least Developed Countries in a number of areas, these eight areas we're going to take a look at now.
    00:02:58 They want to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. They want to achieve universal primary education. That means all primary school-age children should be attending school. Promote gender equity and empower women. Reduce child mortality. That means, reduce the number of children who are dying before the age of five.
    00:03:17 And improve maternal health for mothers, so that they're not dying in childbirth, like they do in many countries. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. Ensure environmental sustainability. And develop a global partnership for development. That means going forward, getting countries to be committed to partnering with one another to ensure increased development.
    00:03:41 Just to quickly review this section, the United Nations is an international organization established to promote peace and global cooperation and improved the standards of living. The Millennium Development Goals are eight goals to improve the condition of people around the world. And these include things like a focus on health, education, and development in general. Thanks so much for joining me in this section, and I look
    00:04:03 forward to seeing you in our next section, where we talk a little bit more about these Least Developed Countries and some of the geographic, social, and political characteristics that are contributing to them being Least Developed Countries. See you back in a minute. Thanks.

! Section 2

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi, I'm Jane, your instructor. Welcome back to Barriers to Economic Growth. This is section two. Our objective for this section is to examine geographic, social, and political characteristics of Least Developed Countries, LDCs, that inhibit economic growth. Well, when we're talking about barriers to economic development there's really a few things that go into the
    00:00:22 mix, low levels of some social welfare, foreign debt, widespread disease, and political instability. So you take these characteristics and you put them all together, it's sort of the perfect storm for adding to, or hampering, economic growth for these Least Developed Countries. So let's talk a little bit more about each one of these. Now for low levels of social welfare, we're really talking
    00:00:46 about a lack of public infrastructure and a low standard of living among the population. They have less access to hospitals and to health care. And as a result, they are high infant mortality rates. Also in many cases high maternal mortality rates. They have unsafe drinking water and insufficient sewer systems. So they are drinking water that may carry waterborne diseases.
    00:01:09 And as a result they have higher rates of disease among their population. They have underdeveloped educational systems, low literacy rates, no universal free public education. That means, for parents, families have to actually pay money to send their children to school. Which means, in many cases, a lack of access for girls. When families are trying to decide among their children
    00:01:36 who they're going to send to school to be educated, more likely than not, they're going to send their boys. So girls are going to stay home, do some of the chores around the house, learn more of the domestic trades. There's also low graduation rates because you don't have a lot of children going to school. In many cases families can't pay for them to go past primary school.
    00:01:59 So they're not going on to high school, not going on to college. So the graduation rates are low. Now this means you have fewer university educated professionals in the society. So these people are some of the people who can really add value to the country, to the community. For example, if someone goes and gets a university degree
    00:02:21 and they've done it in a science field where they've learned about how to improve some of the drinking water. Or they've learned about building safer wells, and they're able to bring that knowledge back to their community. That might help improve their community, might help improve their country, and be a stepping stone to becoming a more developed country.
    00:02:41 But if you don't have people with these degrees, who aren't going on, they can't bring that knowledge base back to their community. Now the demographics. We see a high birth rates and high death rates, with low life expectancies. So you have a lot of people being born and a lot of people dying, and low life expectancies.
    00:03:02 And part of that is because of the rampant disease. They also have high dependency rates, that means we have a very youthful population. As much as half of the population is under 15 in these Least Developed Countries. So they're not contributing to the economy. They don't have jobs that are being taxed. They're not adding money back.
    00:03:22 They don't have a lot of purchasing power, so they're not going out to stores. They're not shopping. They are not putting money back into the economy to flow like that. And they're also using up resources, especially in health care situations, where the younger population and the oldest population are going to be the ones who are going to
    00:03:40 require the most amount of health care. Now child labor is another issue that comes up when we're talking about these countries. And in many cases, what we see is child trafficking. And this is basically children, in some cases, are being sold or leased out by families. Oftentimes given away in exchange for the promises of wages.
    00:04:03 So families think that their child is being leased out while they're getting their child's wages for the work that they're doing. Or they're being promised that they're going to get wages. A lot of these children end up as street vendors or as servants. They are often exploited. Many times the wages aren't sent home.
    00:04:22 Many times they're not given any education. And they're sometimes the most vulnerable to physical or sexual abuse. Sometimes they're sold to factories, where they can work up to 20 hours a day. So child trafficking is a very big problem in some of these places. Now most of these children that are sold or that are
    00:04:42 trafficked are girls. Another issue that comes up in these least developed countries is sweatshops. Which obviously conjures up the image of people working in very dark, dimly lit, hot factory-type settings where perhaps textiles or other things are produced. Now in reality only about 5% of the population, or 5% of children in the world under 14, actually
    00:05:06 work in these places. But it's really a controversial issue. They aren't very low wages but what the controversy is, is that children are able to contribute to their family's income. But at the same time they're not going to school. So we see situations where these children are actually out earning money being able to contribute that back to
    00:05:29 their family who oftentimes desperately needs it. And so it becomes very controversial when you talk about whether or not children should be out working in the so-called sweatshops or in factory-type situations. Foreign debt. Well, in the 1960s and '70s when many, especially in Africa, countries gained independence, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund issued loans.
    00:05:55 The loans were supposed to fund development projects and infrastructure: building roads, bridges, dams, things like that. But the money often did not go toward the intended purpose. And what we saw was a lot of it being squandered, stolen, a lot of the dictatorial governments taking that money for themselves. Dictators making off with money, often
    00:06:19 using it to wage war. So what we see is today many of these Democratic Republics are actually repaying the dictator's loans from 30 or more years ago. Now these repayments actually hamper their economic development because the payments often exceed the revenue. So these countries are having to pay more just pay off their
    00:06:40 debt where they're not even earning that much. So there is this international movement among many people to actually forgive debt for some of these countries. Now structural adjustment loans were something that came out of the '80s and '90s. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank issued loans with some strings attached. They were loans that were offered in exchange for
    00:07:04 economic and governmental reforms, like privatizing industries such as oil drilling, removing tariffs, and holding free elections. But some of these terms actually ended up causing more problems. So some of the promised returns did not materialize. And critics argued that the loans benefit developed nations rather than the underdeveloped nations who
    00:07:27 they are supposed to be helping. The terms actually forced nations to reduce spending in other areas like health care and education, because they're so busy being focused on this privatization of industry, and creating a more democratic free election system. Now also political instability is something else that we talked about the beginning of this section, that is it part of this mix.
    00:07:49 Countries are unable to maintain stable democratic governments. They alternate, oftentimes between military and civilian leadership. So there'll be, in some cases, a military dictator will take over,. If that person gets ousted then we go back to having civilian leadership, but there's a
    00:08:07 lot of back and forth. We see widespread corruption occurring, poor leadership, and it's often difficult to remove some of these leaders from power. So international aid contributions are often misused and then aid is decreased as a result. And we see a lot of this happening throughout Africa and in various different places.
    00:08:30 And one example would be just the changing from Zaire, when Mobutu was in office, who is a military dictator, then finally now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, when he was able to be forcibly removed by the people. Now economic instability often increases political instability. So if a country is not doing well financially that often
    00:08:56 creates chaos. And it creates this opportunity for a dictator to seize power because they're able to promise a lot of things, and people often support them initially. At the same time political instability increases economic instability. So we see this cycle where one part of the instability, economic instability, can create political instability.
    00:09:20 And at the same time when there's political instability that creates economic instability. As we've just talked about Disease is another major problem. Widespread disease directly affects economic development. HIV/AIDS is a major disease that is affecting millions of people, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. And worldwide infections have exceeded 40 million.
    00:09:47 It lowered the national life expectancy. And when that happens we see that there's fewer working-age people, they're not able to contribute as much to the economy. Another big disease, malaria, it's prevalent again in tropical regions. So again we're talking sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Asia, and 150,000 people die from malaria each month.
    00:10:12 And it's difficult to prevent, why, because malaria is actually spread from the bite of mosquito. Resources are often diverted to increase health care costs. So when you have a country that has a lot of endemic diseases, you see that the government is having to spend money on disease. They're not able to spend money on improving infrastructure.
    00:10:36 They're not able to spend money on building up communications and technology and things like that. And also workers who are sick can't contributed to the economy. They're not able to go to work, so they're not getting paid. They're not getting taxed. They don't have purchasing power or money that they can put
    00:10:54 back into the economy. Looking at this map of world malaria risk, you can see that the places where it's dark red, almost the maroon, those are the places where malaria is endemic. Those are the places that are most likely to be affected. And the treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, they're spending approximately $12 billion a year is actually lost just to this disease.
    00:11:27 That's health costs, work time, decreased productivity. And malaria's spread through the mosquito, like we said, the best way to prevent it, because there is no vaccine right now, is for people to actually sleep in malaria tents, to limit their chance of infection. Because insecticides only can work so much and so oftentimes they spray the outside the tent with insecticides. But if insecticide use goes down the mosquito population
    00:11:57 goes back up. So really the only way to prevent malaria is to eradicate mosquitoes. Just to quickly review this section Barriers to Economic Development. We see low levels of social welfare. The infrastructure, such as schools and health care, is often lacking in many of these countries.
    00:12:20 The demographics limit the workforce. Foreign debt is prevalent. Structural adjustment loans limit how nations spend their money. There's political instability. And widespread disease. So thank you so much for joining me in this section, and I look forward to seeing you in our next section when
    00:12:41 we wrap up our discussion of Barriers to Economic Development. Have a great day. Thanks.

! Section 3

    00:00:01 JANE: Hi, I'm Jane, your instructor. Welcome back to our discussion on barriers to economic growth. This is section three. Our objective for this section is to explore strategies implemented by governments and private corporations to overcome barriers to economic development. So increasing economic development, will governments
    00:00:16 invest in strategies to increase economic development? And they do this by creating export processing zones, encouraging outsourcing, and passing laws that favor businesses, like trade agreements and tax and infrastructure incentives. And non-governmental organizations also contribute to development. So let's take a look at how this all works.
    00:00:36 Export processing zones are created in regions of a nation to give favorable tax rates to corporations and access to infrastructure and transportation facilities. China is well known for doing this. Businesses get lower labor and production costs and the nation gets substantial job growth. So, for example, where a factory or an assembly plant is located in China, for example, you're going to see
    00:01:03 more people going to work at that facility. So it's creating job growth within a country. Now, along the US-Mexico border, we see Maquiladoras, and particularly along the Texas-Mexico border across from El Paso, Texas, in the city of Ciudad Juarez. Parts manufactured in the United States are assembled in Mexico and then shipped to US stores. So we see this with things like automobiles.
    00:01:32 Or, the different parts can be made in the United States or in other countries, and then the automobile itself is assembled in Mexico and then brought to the United States to be sold on car lots there. But, these are extremely controversial. Why? Well, we've said that the labor costs and production costs are lower.
    00:01:49 Well, for many of the workers in Mexico, they're making less than $5 an hour with no benefits. Now, critics say that this is problematic, because the majority of the workforce are living in slums, they're exploited, and furthermore, they don't have rights, and there are environmental issues because there's not as many environmental regulations. Pollution is a big issue, pollution of
    00:02:15 water and air and soil. Now, outsourcing is a little different from an export processing zone. Now, this is business process outsourcing. Now, India does this really well. Cities in India specialize in providing services to international corporations in the areas of information technology and customer service call centers.
    00:02:35 Now, there are advantages to businesses, why companies in The United States and Europe would want to outsource. They want to do this because they get lower labor, real estate, and infrastructure costs. So it costs less to operate a call center in India than it does in either Europe or the United States. But, there are also benefits to India and to the people of India.
    00:03:01 Well-paying jobs grow rapidly. Although many of these corporations are paying Indians one third of what they might be paying Americans or Europeans to do the same job, these jobs are actually quite well-paying in India compared to the national average, sometimes up to 10 or 20% greater, 10 to 20 times greater, of the national average. So they're well-paying jobs.
    00:03:27 They also encourage people to stay and complete their education, because these jobs require you to have college degrees in many cases. We're also seeing that people have to be bilingual, so they have to speak their native language, in many cases would be Bengali or Punjab, but they have to then also be able to speak English. Companies provide advanced training and management
    00:03:52 opportunities. Now, governments create incentives, tax incentives and tariff reductions provided. Now, one example is a comprehensive trade agreement like NAFTA, which is the North American Free Trade Agreement. This allows Canada, the United States, and Mexico to enjoy a free-trade zone. Trade barriers are removed, tariffs are reduced, and
    00:04:17 there's increased trade among the three nations. And there are the economic blocs, such as the European Union, which created a single market. Workers are able to move to whichever member country of the European Union they need to. They can easily get jobs in any. There's no taxes when goods are shipped from one country to another.
    00:04:38 And there's also a common currency, which member nations can partake in. There may be also regionally targeted islands of development, smaller areas, often in highly developed areas, in a less-developed country, new modern cities that are built to attract businesses. Corporations build infrastructures for their employees.
    00:05:00 So we see this. Sometimes, though, they might even build housing for their employees to live in, and so that's why it's called an island development. It's sort of just this little pocket where the economy is booming, and they're trying to really build it up. Now, non-government organizations also assist in economic development.
    00:05:22 For example, the United Nations, which we talked about in section one, and in other non-governmental organizations, they might provide micro-enterprise business loans, and encouraging people to start taking small business loans out, so that they can go in and start up their own businesses. And examples include Opportunity International. That's a partnership of more than 40
    00:05:46 organizations around the globe. They give out loans for people living in underdeveloped regions to start their own business, and no collateral requirements, just a few hundred dollars. Or Heifer International. This provides people with a cow, maybe a few sheep, and so forth, so that a small farmer can get started a milk business, or a wool business, a dairy
    00:06:09 business, or a wool business. And this is going to encourage growth in rural and in impoverished areas. So just to review this section, investment strategies to increase economic development include export processing zones, outsourcing, and incentives such as tax incentives or tariff reductions. Non-governmental organizations also contribute to
    00:06:30 development, like the United Nations and other NGOs. Now, thinking about poverty around the world, and how many underdeveloped nations there are around the world, I just want to leave you thinking about what level of responsibility does the developed world have to promoting development for the underdeveloped world, for these least-developed countries? Do Americans bear the brunt of that responsibility?
    00:07:01 Is it a global responsibility? And what should people be doing? Should they be using tax dollars to help set up AIDS clinics in South Africa, or force banks to write off debt or forgive debt that is owed to them by countries like Ethiopia? What responsibility do the most developed countries have, the world leaders have, to assisting some of these
    00:07:23 least-developed countries? Just think on that, if you will, until I see you again next time. Thanks so much for joining me. Have a great day
