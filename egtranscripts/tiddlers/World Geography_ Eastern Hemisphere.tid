title: World Geography: Eastern Hemisphere
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

! Section 1
    00:00:00 TEACHER: In this lesson, we're working to answer the lesson question, how can you describe the geography of the Eastern Hemisphere? We're going to focus on the physical and human geography of the Eastern Hemisphere, including different continents and major cities. We'll answer the lesson question as we
    00:00:20 learn about different cultures that are specific to these regions. We'll see the different traditions, languages, and religions that have developed in these places. First, let's discuss the land masses and bodies of water in the Eastern Hemisphere.

! Section 2
    00:00:00 TEACHER: Let's revisit the continents we discussed earlier in this lesson. Physical geography varies throughout the Eastern Hemisphere. Asia is the largest and most diverse continent in terms of geography, vegetation, and animal life. Africa is the second largest continent in the world.
    00:00:20 Europe is the second smallest continent, and Australia and Oceania is the smallest continent. Oceania is made up of thousands of islands throughout the South Pacific Ocean. These continents contain some of the world's most impressive mountain ranges. {{Some of the major mountain ranges in the Eastern Hemisphere are the Alps, Caucasus, Atlas, and Himalayas.||hl1}}
    00:00:47 The Alps and Himalayas are discontinuous, meaning they have gaps. The Alps stretch across parts of Austria, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Slovenia, Croatia, among others. The Caucasus mountains extend from the northern frontiers of Turkey and Iran to the southernmost portion of Russia. The Atlas Mountains form a type of backbone for Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.
    00:01:18 {{The Himalayas form parts of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Nepal, and Bhutan.||hl1}} Not pictured here, but important to note--the MacDonnell ranges are major landforms in Australia. Let's take a look at some of the physical features in the Eastern Hemisphere besides mountain ranges. A desert is an extremely dry and large area of land. Deserts have very little vegetation or plant life.
    00:01:45 Here in Africa, we see two deserts-- the Sahara and Namib. The Sahara is 3,500,000 square miles, while the Namib is 81,000 square miles. Lying over the borders of China and Mongolia is the Gobi Desert. The Gobi Desert is 500,000 square miles. And finally, in Australia we have the Great Victoria Desert,
    00:02:17 and the Great Victoria Desert is 220,000 square miles. Now, try identifying the continents in the Eastern Hemisphere.

! Section 4
    00:00:00 TEACHER: The major oceans in the Eastern Hemisphere are the {{Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean.||hl1}} The Atlantic Ocean-- here and here-- covers about 20% of the Earth's surface. It separates the continents of Europe and Africa in the Eastern Hemisphere.
    00:00:19 The Pacific Ocean--over here-- is the largest ocean on Earth. It lies between the continents of Asia and Australia. The Indian Ocean--over here, in the middle-- is the smallest ocean on Earth, and covers the area from the tips of Africa and Australia. Next we'll look at seas in the Eastern Hemisphere. The Eastern Hemisphere has various smaller seas,
    00:00:42 and gulfs as well. The {{Mediterranean Sea--right here-- stretches from the Atlantic Ocean on the west to Asia. It separates Europe from Africa.||hl2}} The {{Black Sea, just above it, is a large inland sea at the southernmost part of Europe||hl2}}. The {{Caspian Sea, to the right of that, is the world's largest body of inland water.
    00:01:06 It is next to the Caucasus mountains.||hl2}} The {{Arabian Sea--right here, down below-- is in the northwest part of the Indian Ocean.||hl2}} The {{Red Sea is in the Middle East||hl2}}, and the {{Persian Gulf-- right there--is between the Arabian Peninsula and southwestern Iran.||hl2}} Now, do you think that you can identify oceans and seas in the Eastern Hemisphere?
    00:01:33 Give it a go.

! Section 6
    00:00:00 TEACHER: Madagascar, found right here on this map, is an island located off the southeast coast of Africa, in the Indian Ocean. An island is an area of land that's surrounded on all sides by water. Here we see the Indian Ocean surrounding Madagascar. Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world,
    00:00:21 and it's home to some of the most unique plant and animal life in the world. Over 175,000 animal species and 12,000 plant species can be found only in Madagascar. Now, let's explore the major rivers in Africa. The major rivers of Africa are the Nile, the Zambezi, and the Congo Rivers. The Nile River is considered the longest river in the world.
    00:00:47 The Zambezi River is the fourth longest river in Africa, and flows through 6 countries. The Congo River is the deepest river in the world. Now let's look at islands and rivers in Asia. Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines are all Asian countries that are also islands. Notice the Pacific Ocean surrounds Japan. Japan is located in East Asia, in the Northern Pacific Ocean.
    00:01:16 The Indian and Pacific Oceans surround Indonesia. Indonesia is off the coast of mainland Asia, and is found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Then we also have the Philippines. The Pacific Ocean lies to the east of the Philippines. The Philippines are in Southeast Asia, in the Western Pacific Ocean. There are also notable islands in other parts of Asia.
    00:01:43 Sri Lanka is located off the south coast of India, and it's found right here on this map. The Indian Ocean surrounds Sri Lanka, and we can see that right here. Sri Lanka has a tropical landscape with sandy beaches, it has rainforests, plains, and highlands, and it experiences heavy rainfall in the fall and the spring.
    00:02:10 Another land form that you might be familiar with is called a peninsula, and that's very similar to an island. A peninsula is an area of land that is surrounded on three sides by water. There are two notable peninsulas in Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Korean peninsula. The Arabian Peninsula is surrounded by the Red Sea
    00:02:32 on the west and southwest, the Arabian Sea on the South and Southeast, the Gulf of Aden on the South, and the Persian Gulf on the east. And we can see how it is surrounded on all three sides here. The northern countries of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are recognized as the limit of Arabia. The Korean peninsula, over here, extends
    00:02:54 from China in East Asia. It is made up of two countries, North Korea and South Korea. The Korean peninsula is surrounded by the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan, and we can see that it is also surrounded on all three sides. Let's now explore the major rivers of Asia. The major rivers of Asia are the Mekong, Yangtze, Yellow, Ganges, and Indus Rivers.
    00:03:17 Let's take a look at each. The Mekong River, found over here on the map, naturally reserves its flow of water for part of the year after the rainy season. The Yangtze is the longest in Asia, and that is found above the Mekong there. The Yellow River is named after the color of the soil that it carries.
    00:03:38 It's found up here. The Ganges River flows from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, found here. And then, finally, the Indus River in South Asia is found right here. On the next slide, we're going to focus on the islands and the major rivers in Europe. The British Isles are located off the Northwestern coast
    00:04:02 of Europe. The British Isles refers to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The United Kingdom consists of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Let's take a look at each. Ireland, found right here, has large sections of green fields and mountainous coastline. Northern England and Scotland, which is generally this area,
    00:04:23 are covered with rough and uneven mountains. The coastal plain of eastern England is covered with marshlands, and the southern part of England has flat farmland, over here. Here, surrounding the United Kingdom and Ireland, are the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. Let's now explore the major rivers in Europe and how they flow through the continent.
    00:04:51 The major rivers in Europe are the Volga River, Danube River, and the Rhine River. The Volga River is the longest river in Europe, right here. The Danube River has the most international river basin in the world, extending into 19 countries, and that is right here. And the Rhine River serves as a natural border between Germany, Switzerland, France,
    00:05:16 Liechtenstein, and Austria. And the Rhine River is found here. A river basin is the land that water flows across or under on its way to a river. Now, let's review what we've learned so far.

! Section 9
    00:00:00 TEACHER: In this lesson, we're working to answer the lesson question, how can you describe the geography of the Eastern Hemisphere? You learned about the physical geography. Now you're going to learn about human geography. We're going to focus on the regions and major countries and cities and the populations in each place.
    00:00:20 First, let's discuss human geography in Africa.

! Section 10
    00:00:00 TEACHER: Human geography is a social science that focuses on human systems and communities, and how they interact with their environment. It focuses on population, communities, economics, and people's interactions with one another. Take a look at this photo. How are the people interacting with one another
    00:00:19 and with their environment? The eastern hemisphere includes many different countries, cultures, and urban centers. Africa, in particular, is culturally diverse and growing rapidly. Africa is often separated into five distinct regions, listed here, and shown on the map. So I'm going to use the key, because it's
    00:00:39 a little bit easier to find. In green, we have West Africa, North Africa is red, Central Africa blue, Eastern Africa in purple, orange is Southeast Africa, and light yellow is Southern Africa. One of the more populated countries in each region is labeled. Those are Egypt, Nigeria, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
    00:01:06 Madagascar, and South Africa I want to show you more specific countries in Africa and some major cities. Being the second largest continent, it's no surprise that Africa has the most countries of any continent. There are 54 countries in Africa. The largest African country by landmass
    00:01:28 is Algeria, found over here, at 919,595 square miles. The smallest African country by land mass is Seychelles, which has an area of 174 square miles, found over here. Seychelles is a group of islands in the Western Indian Ocean, and it's considered to be part of eastern Africa. The largest African city by population is Lagos, Nigeria, found here, with 21 million people.
    00:01:59 You may have heard of another major city that's pictured here on the map Cairo, Egypt. And can you tell me what country has the city Cape Town, also a major city. We saw a photo of Cape Town earlier in this lesson. If you said South Africa, down here, then you would be correct. As Africa's cities continue to grow, so does the population.
    00:02:23 Africa's current population is more than 1.2 billion. People predict that the population will double to reach $2.4 billion by 2050. It's one of the fastest growing continents. About 16% of the world's population lives in Africa. And over 40% of people in Africa live in urban areas, urban meaning cities, as opposed to rural out in the country.
    00:02:48 Let's review this thematic map together. Using the key, right here, we can see the projected average population growth between 2010 and 2050 by countries in Africa. Dark red is greater than 160% percent, and the color graduation continues to lighten with less and less growth all the way to this light pink--
    00:03:14 or light--excuse me, light yellow, down here, which indicates 0% to 20% growth. Next, try identifying the regions of Africa.

! Section 12
    00:00:00 TEACHER: The major regions of Asia are listed here on the left, and then again shown over here on this map. So let's use the key to identify each of the regions. In purple, we have the Middle East; blue, Central Asia; green, North Asia; orange, East Asia; red, South Asia; and yellow, Southeast Asia.
    00:00:22 A country in each region is labeled. We have Russia, Afghanistan, Iran, China, India-- and I was wondering, can you identify the region where Indonesia is located? That would be Southeast Asia. You will notice the western part of Russia is also part of Europe. Asia is a vast region that has dense urban areas.
    00:00:47 The human geography in Asia is very diverse. There are 47 countries in Asia. The largest Asian country by population is China, with 1.3 billion people. The largest Asian country by land mass is Russia, at 6.5 million square miles. The smallest Asian country by land mass is the Maldives-- right here--at 115 square miles.
    00:01:16 And the largest Asian city by population is Tokyo, Japan-- over here--with 37.8 million people. Japan is a group of many islands. With that many people in one country, how many people do you think live in Asia altogether? There are more than 4.5 billion people living in Asia today. That's nearly 60% of the world's population. Nearly 50% of people in Asia live in an urban area.
    00:01:50 The population in Asia has experienced great increases, but its rapid growth is expected to slow down over time. Let's read this graph together, and it shows the population changes from 1960 to projected 2050. It shows population change by percent, and as you can see, it was just below 2% in 1960. It increased to 2.5% in 1970, and then held at 2% in the '80s and '90s, and then it began to decrease,
    00:02:21 and it is projected to continue to decrease into the future. Next, try interpreting a graph about population changes.

! Section 14
    00:00:00 TEACHER: Like Asia and Africa, Europe can be divided into regions that share physical and sometimes cultural characteristics. We see five major regions listed on the left here and then again shown over here on the map. In orange, we have Northern Europe; in this greenish blue, we have Central Europe; in purple, Western Europe;
    00:00:22 pink, Southern Europe, and Green, Eastern Europe. You can see how the regions names relate or designate the location of each region. Here is Central Europe. And then we have, to the North, to the East, South, and West. Central Europe shares characteristics with both Western Europe and Eastern Europe. Some of the countries in the different regions
    00:00:49 work together for the good of their citizens in a very unique way. Of the 49 countries that make up Europe, 28 of them are members of the European Union or the EU. The European Union is a collection of countries that work together on issues like trade, defense and protection, and citizens' rights. Here, we see some of the major cities in Europe.
    00:01:12 See if you can locate them on the map before I label them. We have London, England right here; Paris, France right here; Berlin, Germany; and Rome, Italy. They are all located in countries that are members of the EU. New members are coming mainly from Eastern and Central Europe. Europe is the second smallest continent,
    00:01:36 with more than 700 million people. Europe makes up only about 10% of the world's population. Nearly 75% of people in Europe live in an urban area. Now can you see the areas with larger concentrations of people on this map? The key shows persons per square kilometer. The dark red is the more populated an area; and the dark bluish green is the most densely populated areas.
    00:02:06 Despite the dense population in urban areas, there are parts of Europe that are declining in population. In contrast to the rapidly growing population of Africa, Europe's population has been steadily decreasing over time. Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria have some of the greatest declining populations. You can see this in this chart showing a percent change in this column between 2010 and 2015.
    00:02:37 A large part of Europe's population is aging. The median age in Europe is over 40, and this will cause a decrease in population. Next, you will interpret a map about population density.

! Section 16

    00:00:00 TEACHER: Oceania is the name used for Australia and the many islands throughout the South Pacific Ocean. Australia is the only landmass that is both a continent and a country. The islands that make up Australia and Oceania can be divided into four regions. Let's identify them here on the map.
    00:00:18 Australasia is found here, Polynesia here, Melanesia in the middle, and Micronesia up here to the north. Australasia is made up of Australia and New Zealand, though sometimes, New Zealand is considered part of Polynesia. And you can see why, since it's located between the two. Even though it's quite far away, Guam, up here, is officially a US territory in Micronesia.

{{Regions of Australia and Oceania}}{{Regions of Australia}}

    00:00:47 Australia and Oceania are among some of the least populated regions in the world after Antarctica. There are only 15 countries in Australia and Oceania. The largest country by land mass is Australia at 2.9 million square miles. The largest city by population is Sydney, Australia, right here, with a population of 4.5 million.
    00:01:14 And Auckland, New Zealand is the largest urban area in New Zealand, found here, with around 1.5 million people. Most people live on the coasts of Australia, New Zealand, or Papua New Guinea. The total population of Australia and Oceania is almost 40.1 million people. That's less than 1% of the world population. Most people in Australia and Oceania--
    00:01:41 a little over 70% live in an urban area. This map right here shows the population by percentage. The darker colors indicate denser population. You can see how sparsely populated the central part of Australia is. Most of Australia is made up of the Outback, a large desert and semi-dry region. It might be hard to imagine, but Australia
    00:02:05 had an even smaller population at one time. Many islands in Australia and Oceania were settled by indigenous people and colonized by Europeans. To colonize is to take control of and move into a place. Australia and Oceania islands eventually gained independence after being colonies for a long time. Australia gained independence from Great Britain in 1901.
    00:02:30 Australia's population increased significantly after becoming independent. Modern population growth is 1.4% per year, and we can see that growth right here on this chart. The people of New Zealand have a similar history. New Zealand gained independence from Britain in 1947. Since then, the population has increased. Modern population growth is 0.97% per year.
    00:03:03 Now it's your turn to identify regions and countries in Australia and Oceania.

! Section 18
    00:00:00 TEACHER: You're doing a great job. In this lesson, as you know, we are working to answer this lesson question. How can you describe the geography of the Eastern Hemisphere? You just learned about human geography. Let's check that one.
    00:00:15 Now let's take a closer look at different cultures and traditions in the Eastern Hemisphere. We're going to focus on different traditions, languages, and religions that have developed in these places. So first, let's take a look at the culture of Africa.

! Section 19
    00:00:00 TEACHER: Africa is made up of diverse peoples. Many people live in bustling cities. Some people live in traditional ethnic groups. Traditional ethnic groups moved from place to place based on rainfall. They needed water to survive and take care of their animals. Africa is marked by its diversity.
    00:00:17 African cultures developed based on human migration. Traditional cultures learned to adapt to the climate. The Massai, Tuareg, and Mbuti are examples of traditional cultures. In this photo, we see a Massai man in traditional clothing. Notice the loose fit and the sandals as adaptations to the climate during the dry season. Let's look at some other diverse things about Africa.
    00:00:43 Because of the large number of cultures and ethnic groups in Africa, many different languages are spoken. Africa has a very large number of languages and ethnic groups. Thousands of ethnic groups and tribes live in Africa. And more than 1,000 languages are spoken. Many countries are multilingual, meaning people speak more than one language.
    00:01:05 The most widely spoken language is Swahili, with over 100 million speakers. Language is only one aspect of culture. We will explore some other aspects next. Three major forms of religion exist in Africa, Christianity, Islam and folk religions. We can see this here. People in Africa follow both major world religions and folk
    00:01:27 religions. The major religions in Africa are Christianity and Islam, and folk religions are based on traditions and are animistic. Animistic is the idea that every natural thing has a soul. The African traditional religions vary from society to society, but most share certain common beliefs and practices. Next we'll focus on changes in African culture.
    00:01:52 One of the biggest events to affect African culture was the transatlantic slave trade. European colonialism introduced the slave trade in Africa, which transported slaves across the Atlantic Ocean to many colonies, particularly in the Americas. European colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade dramatically changed African culture. {{The transatlantic slave trade affected
    00:02:14 Western Africa, decreased the population in the area, delayed agricultural development and industrialization, and caused conflicts between groups.||hl1}} Conflicts in Africa continue today. Agricultural development was delayed, because many able-bodied people left Africa, thus there were fewer people to work in agriculture. The slave trade affected Africa in many ways.
    00:02:37 While people continue to live in poverty due to the poor economic-- poor economy in many places in Africa, conditions are improving.

! Section 21
    00:00:00 TEACHER: The people of Asia also display great diversity. {{Sometimes distinct cultures developed because of isolation created by physical barriers, such as seas, mountains, and deserts. The cultures in Asia are based on diverse ethnic, political, and religious groups.||hl1}} The Middle East is mostly made up
    00:00:20 of Iranians, Turks, Jews, and Arabs. South Asia has mostly Indian cultures. China and India influence Southeast Asia. East Asia has mostly Korean, Japanese, and Chinese influences. And Russian culture dominates North Asia. The different regions are culturally dominated by the most powerful countries in a region.
    00:00:45 For example, Northern Asia is dominated by Russian cultural influences of Siberia. Indian movies and food greatly affect the culture of South Asia. This image here shows one of Asia's biggest cultural events-- Chinese New Year, which is actually celebrated in many different places.
    00:01:05 Asia has a complex base of religions and languages. {{The people of Asia speak hundreds of languages.||hl1}} As Europeans colonized different areas, they brought their different languages. English is one of the most commonly spoken languages in the region, especially in places of business. {{Other languages are based on pictures and symbols.||hl1}}
    00:01:31 Mandarin Chinese is the most widely spoken language in the region. Other top languages include Cantonese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Burmese, and Malaysian to name a few. Religions in Asia are also diverse. {{The five major religions-- Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism are all practiced throughout Asia.||hl1}}
    00:01:54 This map shows concentrations of different religions in different areas. For example, Hinduism is the major religion in India, shown in bright green. And we see different types of Buddhism shown here in bright blue and Buddhism over here in purple as well. As you can see from this map, Asia has a high level of religious diversity.
    00:02:23 Christianity, Islam, and Judaism developed in the Middle East. There is a large percentage of Hindus and Buddhists, and tribal religions also exist in Asia. {{Cultural changes in Asia, apart from religion, are causing some shifts in the way people live. The spread of technology is changing lifestyles and the economy||hl1}}. The introduction of new technologies
    00:02:48 transformed smaller regions into more urban areas. Manufacturing increased, and developing nations gained economic power. The term developing, as it's used here, refers to economic development and improvement in the way that people live in a country. About 60% of the world's population uses cell phones. This is the type of change that is affecting Asia.
    00:03:11 Rural areas are changing into cities. Traditional ways of life are no longer the majority. In this photo here, we see the use of technology, the boys on the laptop, in a very rural setting, this rice field. Next, take a moment to complete a task about Asian culture.

! Section 23

    00:00:00 TEACHER: Europe is the birthplace of Western civilization, including Greek and Roman art, law, literature, and philosophy. These influences continue to be a part of Europe today. It has diverse heritage with people of many different identities living in a small area. Traditional cultures adapted to geography.
    00:00:21 Sea trade was used to develop the region. The man in this photo is navigating a gondola through the canal waters of Venice in Italy. Let's look at the rich cultural traditions of languages in Europe. Most European languages are in the romance, Germanic, and Slavic branches of the Indo-European language family. These developed from the Latin of ancient Rome
    00:00:45 and from ancient Greek. Most of these are spoken in Western and Southern Europe, Portuguese, Spanish, Castilian, French, Italian, and Romanian. English is spoken in Great Britain. {{There are 24 languages spoken in Europe.||hl1}} {{The romance languages include Spanish, Italian, and French||hl2}}. {{Germanic languages include English, German,
    00:01:07 and Scandinavian languages.||hl2}} And {{Slavic languages include Polish and Russian||hl2}}. Next, let's take a look at religions in Europe. {{Most Europeans practice Christianity, Islam, or Judaism||hl1}}. Today, the Muslim population is increasing in some parts of Europe, as people migrate from other countries to Europe.
    00:01:28 On this map, we see percentages of Christianity in purple and Islam in green in Europe. Europe is experiencing incredible shifts in its culture as people migrate to the region. European countries are adapting to many recent cultural changes. Recent immigration is having a large effect on the culture of Europe.
    00:01:48 People are leaving war-torn countries to go to Europe. Refugees are from Syria, Serbia, Eritrea, and Afghanistan. The European Union faces challenges about how to handle migration and the economy. {{The large refugee crisis that began in 2015 is one of the largest human migrations in history||hl1}}. This is a photo of refugees inside a makeshift refugee camp at the border of Greece and Macedonia.
    00:02:15 Next, you will complete a task about European culture.

! Section 25
    00:00:00 TEACHER: Australia and Oceania is a diverse area. Indigenous people and geography contribute to a diverse culture. Indigenous means living or occurring naturally in a specific area. People here have learned to live closely with oceans. Aboriginal cultures have traditional cultural practices
    00:00:20 and beliefs. In fact, there are 720 ethnic groups. In part, cultures there have developed based on the unique physical geography. People who live in Australia and Oceania have learned to survive on the oceans. Aboriginal is the name given to indigenous Australian groups. In this photo, an aboriginal warrior
    00:00:40 is teaching a young girl how to throw a boomerang during a cultural show in Queensland, Australia. A boomerang is a traditional tool that has been used for hunting for hundreds of years. We'll look at languages and religions next, to see how things have changed. When Europeans colonized different areas, they also brought their languages.
    00:01:02 Australia has a variety of traditional and modern languages. There are hundreds of Aboriginal languages. Colonization introduced many Indo-European languages, including Italian and Greek. English is the official language. Next, let's take a look at languages in Oceania. Oceanic languages are called Eastern Austronesian.
    00:01:26 They're spoken from Hawaii to New Guinea to Easter Island. The major languages in Oceania are based on Aboriginal languages. There are about 450 total languages. English was adopted from the colonial period. The main language in New Guinea is English. Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu are other top languages that are spoken in this region.
    00:01:52 Now let's take a look at religions in Australia and Oceania. The most widespread religion in Australia is Christianity. Nearly 23% of people do not follow a religion. Aboriginal religions are also followed. And other religions include Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and Hinduism. Oceania experienced different types of shifts
    00:02:14 in religious affiliations and belief systems. In the past, Oceania practiced traditional religions. With colonization, Christianity spread. Today, most of Oceania is Christian, as depicted on this map. Colonial settlers from Europe brought Christianity. Most people in Oceania are Christian. And the island of Fiji also has a significant number
    00:02:38 of Hindus and Muslims. How do you think culture has changed in Australia and Oceania? Let's take a look. Colonization has had a major effect on the culture of this region. By 1,000 BCE, Polynesians colonized Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia.
    00:02:58 Colonization by Polynesians and Europeans changed the region. Indigenous groups are important parts of contemporary society today. Traditional ways are still taught. However, urban areas are growing. For example, Sydney, Australia, which is pictured here, is a popular destination for tourists. Next, you will analyze culture in Australia and Oceania
