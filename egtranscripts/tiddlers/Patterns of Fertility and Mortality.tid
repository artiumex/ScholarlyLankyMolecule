! Section 1

    00:00:01 KIRSTEN: Hi, my name is Kirsten and I'll be your instructor today. How many children are in your family? Maybe you're one of three, four, or even more children, similar to the picture here on the left. Or maybe you're one of only two siblings, like the picture here on the right. Well in America in the past, family sizes
    00:00:19 have been quite large. Many families in the 1800s and early 1900s had five, seven, or even more children. But since the 1970s, that all began to change. Now family size is on the decline, and maybe you are part of the average American family size, having just one sibling, or the increasing number of children who are only children.
    00:00:40 Some couples in America are choosing to have no children at all, and as a result the average size of family is shrinking in America, as it is throughout much of the developed world. Why do populations track the number of children being born, and what does it tell us about population growth? In this lesson, we're going to learn all about the demographics of birth and death, and what it means for
    00:01:02 you in society. Our lesson today is Patterns of Fertility and Mortality. Our objectives: to define the terms fertility and mortality, and understand their meanings in term of demographics, to understand the relevance of total fertility rate, mortality rate, and infant mortality rate, to identify factors that influence fertility and mortality, and to analyze differences in the fertility and mortality rates
    00:01:28 of low income versus high income countries. In this section, we'll be looking at the first two objectives, and as we go along we're going to have quite a few words that are highlighted in purple. Pay close attention to those, they're part of your vocabulary terms for this lesson. OK, so we're going to learn in this section about what is fertility and what is mortality.
    00:01:49 What do these terms mean? Well, fertility and mortality mean the number of children being born and the number of people dying in a particular society. And what we find is if we take a look at populations throughout the world and we compare high income, developed countries to low income, developing countries we see very different pictures with regard to the number of
    00:02:09 children a typical woman has, as well as the percentage of the population that would be expected to die in that year. So there are significant differences between industrialized and developing worlds. So again, the industrialized world would include countries like the United States, very wealthy countries that have economies based on manufacturing, services, and the like.
    00:02:31 And the developing world, these are countries that are less developed, typically have stagnant economies or struggling economies and typically have lower family incomes in these types of countries as well. So in the developing world-- so again, we're looking at countries in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, southeast Asia-- many of these countries have higher rates of fertility and
    00:02:53 mortality in developing countries. So what this means is if you look at the population growth in a country in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, chances are the fertility rate is going to be much higher than it is in the United States. In the United States, every woman has about two children, whereas if we look at many of the countries in the developing world, that rate is 2.5, 3, or even higher.
    00:03:17 In addition, these countries have higher rates of mortality, which means a bigger percentage of their population dies each year. This is very difficult to study in many cases, because more accurate data is available in developed countries because they have the money to take censuses, they have the money to hire people to go out and actually track birth rates and the like.
    00:03:40 And as a result, sometimes it's difficult to track these types of rates in the developing world because these countries are struggling economically. So first, let's take a look at fertility. And we're going to take a look at total fertility rate. Total fertility rate measures the number of children that would be born if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years.
    00:04:02 And again, it's measured in births per women, so it might be 2.0, 2.2, and the like. A total fertility rate below 2 indicates a declining and aging population. So if we see a total fertility rate below 2, that means our population is growing smaller. Maybe only slightly smaller, but smaller and smaller and smaller over time.
    00:04:24 And it means that the average age in our population is growing older. A TFR above 2 indicates a growing population with a declining median age. So what this means, if we see at a total fertility rate at 3 or 3.2 or 2.8, we know that particular population is growing. And on top of that, the average age is declining.
    00:04:47 Because we have so many more children being born than adults, there are more children than there are working adults, adults that are elderly, and the like, typically. And again, we tend to see TFRs below 2 in the developed world and TFRs above 2 in the developing world. So let's look at total fertility rates in the developing world.
    00:05:12 A high total fertility rate is typically linked to poverty, lower social status and education of women, rural environments, people who live in subsistence agriculture, and limited knowledge or understanding of family planning practices or contraception. In a country with a high total fertility rate, more children tend to die in infancy or childhood, more families tend to have many more children, so those children can help with
    00:05:40 labor costs, can help on a family farm, can go to work early to help provide for the family, and fewer citizens plan to use technology or contraception to limit the size of their family. So again, high total fertility rate means our population is growing and women are typically having more than two children per woman. So let's look at the problems associated.
    00:06:06 So if a country has a high fertility rate, if we have so many more children being born than adults in the society, what does that mean? Well, this means that typically you can have some problems. You have a growing population, and that could lead to overcrowding, it could lead to problems with food supply. So when we think about countries where already they
    00:06:27 have food issues, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, these countries also tend to have high fertility rates. So we can expect that problem to just get worse as time goes on. Accessibility of government services and funds. This includes anything from sanitation, clean water, to health care and other types of government services. As that population grows, it's more difficult to provide
    00:06:50 those services to everyone. On top of that, they have a young population and that young population is not contributing to the economy, they're not earning money that can be taxed, and yet that young population still has to be taken care of. That young population needs health care, immunizations and checkups. That young population needs schools and the like, so that
    00:07:11 can be very difficult for a country to deal with. Now let's look at what types of countries we see with a very low total fertility rate. Low total fertility rates are seen typically in developed or industrialized nations. So this includes countries like Western Europe, Japan, United States. Typically, women have a much higher socioeconomic status,
    00:07:33 and they also typically have better access to education and more equality in society. These countries also typically have strong education systems and easy availability of contraceptives. Contraceptives are either devices or drugs that you would take in order to prevent pregnancy. In addition, people have access to quality health care. So again, they can talk to their doctors about
    00:07:57 childbirth, they can talk to their doctors about preventing pregnancy and the like. And much of this really has to do with the role of women in society, that's very important. So let's look at the problems associated with a total fertility rate that is low. Now on the surface, it might seem a low total fertility rate is great, but the problem is that there are problems
    00:08:16 associated with this as well. You certainly don't want to have a shrinking population because that can cause problems down the road. So it's very important, you need a balance in population. When you have an aging population-- that means your total fertility rate is low and the number of people in retirement age is growing-- that also causes problems. There sometimes aren't enough
    00:08:35 workers to provide tax money to support the elderly, the elderly need increased health care access. As you get older, your prescription drug costs go up, your hospitalization costs go up, elderly people are typically retirees living on pensions or other retirement packages. Those have to be paid for by younger workers. And as a result, what happens often--
    00:08:59 and we're seeing this in many countries including Japan, where they have negative population growth-- they're worried about labor shortages in the future. So if you have all of these people, these doctors and lawyers who are retiring, we need the same number of doctors and lawyers that are graduating from college to take their place, and that often doesn't happen so labor shortages are an important aspect.
    00:09:21 Family dynamics can also be an issue. When you think about, in many cases, children take care of their parents. It's a lot easier if that burden is shared among several siblings as opposed to having an only child to take care of parents. Or two only children who are married have two sets of parents as well their grandparents, sometimes, to
    00:09:44 take care of. That can be an issue as well. Now, sometimes the government gets involved with fertility rates. This can be trying to get people to have more children or it can be trying to prevent people from having too many children. A good example would be China.
    00:10:00 China has instituted a one-child policy. China has a population in excess of one billion people. They are very concerned about providing services for all their citizens, so the government has come in and said you will only have one child in most cases. And many people believe this to be a violation of people's human rights. If people fail to adhere to the law, they can be heavily,
    00:10:23 heavily fined. This is tracked very publicly, and so many human rights organizations are very concerned with the one-child policy. On top of that, when people in China can only have one child, there is a preference for boys in that society, and as a result we're seeing infanticide, the killing of girl babies, abandoning girl babies, putting girl babies up
    00:10:45 for adoption and the like. So while on the surface it might seem great, let's limit our population growth, there definitely are some bad points to that as well. So in review, we talked about total fertility rate, which measures the number of children that would be born if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years. We talked about the differences between
    00:11:07 industrialized countries versus developing countries. Industrialized countries or developed countries typically have lower total fertility rates. This includes countries in Western Europe, the United States, Japan, for example. Less developed countries typically have high total fertility rates. We see this in south Asia, southeast
    00:11:29 Asia, sub-Saharan Africa. And having a high total fertility rate can be bad in many respects. It can be linked to overpopulation, high poverty, lower economic and social status for women. Thank you very much, and I'll see you next time. Bye.

! Section 2

    00:00:01 KIRSTIN: Hi, welcome back. This lesson is Patterns of Fertility and Mortality. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here. And in this section we'll looking at our third and fourth objectives, to identify factors that influence fertility and mortality, and to analyze differences in the fertility and mortality rates of low-income versus high-income countries.
    00:00:19 Well, in this lesson we've been learning about mortality and fertility rate. Well, in this section, we're going to take a look at the factors that can affect these rates in countries around the world. And we're specifically going to look at low-income countries versus high-income countries. So we're going to start with child mortality.
    00:00:36 And child mortality rates center on how many children lose their lives before age 5 and don't grow up to be teenagers and young adults. Now child mortality rates around the world are closely linked to poverty. UNICEF reports that in 2007, 9.2 million children under the age of 5 died. And the top killers of children under the age of 5
    00:01:00 include pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria. So we're going to look at various countries around the world and various regions around the world at their child mortality rates. And keep in mind what these factors are because we're going to come back to them. So let's take a look at child mortality around the world. If we look at the number of children that died-- and
    00:01:19 remember, it was 9.2 million-- of those, 49% are from Sub-Saharan Africa. 33% are from South Asia. So countries like India, for example. Take a look at industrialized countries. This would include the United States. Less than 1% of child deaths occurred in places like Western Europe or the United States.
    00:01:45 So what of the factors that influence child mortality? Well, it includes political and social stability. Things like war, refugees, education, and the role of status of women. So countries that struggle with these issues tend to have higher child mortality rates. It includes economic factors, such as the distribution of wealth, health spending, sanitation.
    00:02:08 So clean water, clean sewer systems. Clean water and accessibility to health care, accessibility to clean water, those issues can also affect child mortality. And then finally, climate and location. And a big reason is endemic disease. Endemic diseases are diseases that are typically found in certain geographical areas. And malaria is a great example.
    00:02:32 Malaria is typically found in tropical areas, such as in Sub-Saharan Africa. So again, children who live in those climates have a higher risk of death than children who do not. It also include availability of resources. So children that live in Urban areas might have better access to clean water and health care than children that live in rural areas, especially in the poorest
    00:02:53 countries of the world. So let's take a look at child mortality. Many of these deaths and diseases are preventable. So that's one of the biggest issues that organizations, like the United Nations, is looking at. It's not like we can't prevent these diseases, we can. We just have to make sure that we target enough funding and resources for areas that are hardest hit by these issues.
    00:03:14 Ways that we can prevent these deaths include improved sanitation, safe, clean drinking water, education for families about washing their hands to prevent the spread of disease, and so forth. Community development and better nutrition. Now, one of the biggest issues that we see in the developing world is routine diarrhea. Now, occasionally, you might have been hit with this
    00:03:36 intestinal issue, and chances are your mom, or your guardian, or someone gave you some type of electrolyte solution, and that replenished your body. And you probably were fine. And if you get a severe enough case of an intestinal disorder, they'll take you to the hospital where you'll get an IV of fluids to prevent dehydration. And what we see is that in many places in the world, they
    00:03:59 don't have access to things like hydrating mixes of water, sugar, and salt like you would drink off the shelf. And as a result, children often die from dehydration when they get these types of diseases, because they don't have easy access to health care or these types of therapies. And then finally, deaths are more common in developing countries.
    00:04:19 So people who live in the poorest countries in the world who also live in rural areas are at the highest risk of childhood mortality. Next, let's take a look at maternal mortality because what we see is often that these two factors go hand-in-hand. And despite the medical advances that we enjoy in the world today, there is still a risk in giving birth.
    00:04:42 In the past, it was the number 1 killer of women throughout human history. And it's really only been in the last hundred years or so that the risks of maternal mortality has significantly declined to the numbers we enjoy today. But what we find is, is that a mother's health and safety is very dependent again, upon the income of the country in which she lives.
    00:05:04 Women who live in the industrialized world typically have access to health care. They have someone with them, a trained health care provider delivering the child. They have access to neonatal intensive care unit perhaps, if something goes wrong. And then women in the poorest countries of the world don't have that kind of access.
    00:05:24 They don't have doctors and hospitals when they give birth. And so we see very despairing rates of maternal death due to childbirth and childbirth related complication. So still today, many women around the world die giving birth or from those complications resulting from delivery. Now, why do women typically not get the
    00:05:48 health care they need? Well, it can be due to there's a lack of services in their area, or perhaps it's too expensive. And these problems are much more common in underdeveloped and developing countries than they are in developed countries, like the United States and Western Europe. Less than two-thirds of women around the world receive assistance from a skilled health care worker during
    00:06:08 childbirth. So it's a very different situation around the world than here in the West, where the vast, vast majority of women do have either a doctor or a trained midwife assisting them during delivery. So let's take a look at the maternal mortality ratio around the world, and we can see industrialized countries here, it's 8.
    00:06:32 So of every 100,000 live births, 8 women are going to die in childbirth in the industrialized world. So we're talking about the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, Japan, countries like that. Compare that to the African nations. Those are the countries here. In Eastern and Southern Africa, it's 790. In Western and Central Africa, 1,100.
    00:06:56 So you can see, the maternal mortality rate is hundreds of times higher in these countries than it is here in the West. Next, let's take a look at the lifetime risk of maternal death. Now what this means is, what are the chances if you become a mother sometime in your life, or if you're a guy and you do get married and you choose to have children--
    00:07:21 your wife-- what are the chances over your lifetime that you will die in childbirth? And we don't have Western countries on their because they wouldn't even fit on the chart. They would be so far up here, it wouldn't show. But let's take a look at other countries. Specifically, let's look again at these African countries.
    00:07:38 We can see in a course of a woman's lifetime, 1 in 29 women are going to die in childbirth in Eastern and Southern Africa. 1 in 17 women are going to die in childbirth in Western and Central Africa. So that's if we look at their entire lifetime, all the pregnancies and childbirths a woman has. Those are the chances of her dying in childbirth.
    00:08:02 So you can see it's a very significant risk in many parts of the world. Next let's take a look at adolescent fertility rate. This is a great indicator of what kind of factors can lead to girls who are aged 15 to 19 having children. And if we compare the industrialized world again, to other countries, we see in the industrialized nations it's about 20 women.
    00:08:31 There's going to be 20 births per 1,000 women compared again, Sub-Saharan Africa where it exceeds 120. So again, if you live in Sub-Saharan Africa, your chances of having a child, yourself, while still a teenager, is much higher than if you live in the industrialized world. And a lot of that has to do with the age women marry, availability of contraceptives, and as well as
    00:08:56 education and women's role in society. Now I think it's important to note that of the industrialized nations, the country with the highest adolescent fertility rate is the United States. And as of 2006, it was up around 40. So you can see the United States still has a way to go as far as this particular statistic is concerned. But again, it's still not quite what we see in other
    00:09:20 parts of the World. Specifically in Africa. Next, let's take a look at industrialized countries in the industrialized world. So again, Western Europe, United states, Canada, Japan, and so forth, women are having their first child at a later age. The average age for women to give birth to their first
    00:09:37 child in the United States is age 25 and it's 28 in the European Union. And this is due to the advanced education of women. Women in these areas do have access to high school educations. Many, many, many of them go on to college. Women have more of an equal status in these parts of the world than they do perhaps, in the developing world.
    00:10:01 And to let you compare that to other countries. In some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, 40% of teenage girls have at least one child before the age of 18. So we can see it's a very, very different statistic. And you can imagine what those girls lives must be like having children at such a young age, perhaps compared to your own society.
    00:10:22 So in review, developed countries versus developing countries. In developed countries, we have lower child and maternal mortality rates. In developing countries, children survive birth, but often die from disease. And again, those childhood mortality rates are much higher in the developing world than they are in the West and
    00:10:44 in the industrialized world. So factors that influence child and maternal mortality include economic factors, such as availability of health care, the need for people to have more children to help work a family farm. Politics. Many of these countries struggle with stability. War and refugee crises are common, as well as resources.
    00:11:06 Especially things like clean water, access to health care, and education. So in this lesson we've been talking about family size and fertility rates, as well as mortality. And how some children in some parts of the world face risk with regard to childbirth and disease that perhaps you here in the United States do not. So what kind of responsibilities do people
    00:11:31 here in the United States have towards people in the developing world? And what kind of things might we be able to do to decrease the risk of childhood mortality in many of these developing countries? So thank you so much and I'll see you next time. Bye
