PROFESSOR: Hi, I'm Jane, your instructor. Let's take a look at the map in front of us, which shows the speed limits throughout the United States. And as we can see, different places certainly do have different laws. Take, for example, Hawaii here, which has a speed limit of 60 miles per hour on major highways. Then you can see many of these Rocky Mountain region states
00:00:20
have a speed limit of about 75. And then some of these pockets down here in Texas have speed limits of 80 miles per hour. Throughout the United States, some of these states are going to have different laws because each state believes it needs to address its own need. We have smaller administrative units in the United States, and we're going to be talking about those in this lesson.
00:00:45
We're going to be looking at this idea of internal boundaries, and how boundaries that separate areas with different laws, policies, and governments exist within a country. So let's get started. This lesson is "Geography and Internal Boundaries," and this is Section One. Our objectives over the course of the lesson are to
00:01:01
understand the types of internal boundaries including city, county, state, and federal, examine the relationship between district boundaries, socio-economics, and election results, and differentiate between exclaves, enclaves, and territories as internal units. In this section we're going to be focusing on the first objective. Keep in mind you may notice some terms are in bold.
00:01:24
Pay attention to those because they are your vocabulary words. Internal boundaries. We're looking at a map of counties in the state of Washington. But internal boundaries, as we're going to be talking about them in general, are really political boundaries within a country.
00:01:38
So they exist within a country, and as we will see, when we talk more about the United States, they exist even on smaller levels, like we see here in the background, on county levels. Countries are divided into administrative units, and these units are responsible for managing and protecting and controlling territory locally. Internal boundaries in the United States, the largest
00:02:01
type of boundary is a federal boundary, state boundary, county, city, and intracity. And we're going to talk about each one of these in turn. Federal boundaries exist between, in this example, the United States and other countries. So in the background you see an image of the federal border between the United States and Mexico. Free transportation across these boundaries is always
00:02:29
limited, so there are going to be physical barriers and armed protection used. So we see here a fence that's used between the US and Mexico. That is a physical barrier. Whether you want to enter the US or, from the US, you want to enter Canada or Mexico, you're going to have to go through checkpoints--
00:02:48
as well as if you want to enter the US from either of those places, you're going to have to go through checkpoints-- to show your passport and possibly other credentials to prove that you're a citizen of either one of those countries where you're coming from. Some things may be checked. There may be searches of different vehicles driving
00:03:05
across the border. And this is a way to secure borders and boundaries. Other physical barriers, not just man-made barriers like a fence, these can also include things like rivers or mountains or lakes. State boundaries are borders between states, provinces, and districts. A state government in the United States is going to be
00:03:29
responsible for providing many services for the people. The state government's going to maintain law and order, protect property rights, as well as regulate businesses. They can also provide public welfare programs, and they're going to supervise education and maybe maintain some of the roads. These are separate areas represented in the country's government.
00:03:54
And free transportation can be limited for products and trade, so there's sometimes product inspections or weigh stations that tractor-trailer trucks that are carrying items need to check in at. County boundaries are divisions within states. Think back to that first map of Washington we saw. It groups nearby cities together. And counties are going to do many of the same
00:04:23
things that states do. A county is the main type of internal boundary that you're going to see in the United Kingdom and Ireland, where they don't have states. They have this sort of decentralized government system. They are still going to be responsible for maintaining the roads.
00:04:40
They are going to be responsible for maintaining sewage or water treatment. They're going to be responsible for education in the county. But instead of being run by a state governor, they're going to be run instead by some type of board of supervisors. And counties also exist in the United States, where we're grouping nearby cities together,
00:05:08
but within that state. So we have the federal boundary first, then a state boundary, and then within that state we have smaller county boundaries. Then, city boundaries. City or municipal boundaries mark the limits of city governments, and city governments manage the affairs and provide services for the cities, towns, and villages.
00:05:31
And 60% of the people in the United States actually live in these types of municipalities. They mark changes in city codes and policies. And then, within the city, we find intracity boundaries. These can be cities broken down into smaller administrative divisions. In New York City they're often called boroughs. They're called wards in Chicago, and in Los Angeles
00:05:56
they're called districts. In many cases they're setting up the electoral districts, which we're going to be talking more about in the next section. They're also establishing things like school districts. They're breaking the city down into smaller administrative units. Just to quickly review this section, we talked about
00:06:16
internal boundaries, which are political boundaries within a country, and then the levels of internal boundaries in the US, the federal, state, county, city, and intracity. So thanks so much for joining me in this section, and I look forward to seeing you in our next section, where we talk more about these intracity boundaries and how they affect electoral geography. Thanks so much for joining me.
00:06:38
I'll see you soon.

! Section 2
00:00:00
JANE: Hi. I'm Jane, your instructor. Welcome back to our discussion on Geography and Internal Boundaries. This Section 2. Our objective for this section is to examine the relationship between district boundaries, socioeconomics, and election results.
00:00:13
Remember, you may notice on terms that are in bold. Pay attention to those, because they are your vocabulary words. Districts. Well, in the last section, we talked about the United States being divided into different administrative units from federal boundaries to state to county to city to intercity. And in this section we're really going to be focusing on
00:00:36
some of these smaller local governmental called districts. There over 85,000 districts in the United States. Now these include municipalities, , townships and counties, which are then further broken down into school districts, water, sanitation, fire, police, and voting districts. Now the boundary lines are often drawn based on things like population.
00:00:56
For example, in a school district the boundaries might be drawn based on the number of school-age children living in a certain area. Or some of the natural features, for example water districts. The proximity to water might play into how these boundaries are configured. Or physical size.
00:01:16
The police and fire districts may take into account population, but they might also take into account physical size and how much mileage has to be covered. In this section, we're really be focusing on different voting districts, which are going to take into account population. We're going to be focusing on electoral geography, which is sub-field of political geography.
00:01:39
And what electoral geography does is study how voting district boundaries are drawn. Then, once you look at that, in electoral geography, it also analyzes the relationship between election results and the demographics. So looking at how these boundaries are drawn and then how those boundaries-- who is living inside those boundaries and how that
00:02:00
impacts the results of an election. Now the demographics of a voting district are going to be considered including race, ethnicity, and class. Also the representation of power. One political party or group may be more or less represented within a particular district. And then districts are redrawn to reflect changes in population.
00:02:21
So even the redrawing of those comes under this cloud of electoral geography. Now redistricting in the United States. You can see we're looking at two images of Iowa congressional districts in 2002 and 2012. And then comparing that to the Iowa congressional districts in 2012 to 2022. And you'll see that the second image has a fifth district.
00:02:51
Now when we're talking about redistricting in the United States, we're really talking about redrawing of constitutional districts. And this is called reapportionment. And it's mandated by the US Constitution. It occurs every 10 years following the US Census. And what it does is it really redistributes the 435 seats in the House of Representatives among the 50 states according
00:03:13
to the population. So as a population changes in a state, they need greater representation if it's increasing. If it's decreasing, they need less representation. So for example, between 2002 and 2010, Arizona gained a seat and Florida gained a seat, because this is reflecting the number of people that are moving to the sunbelt.
00:03:40
Now where they coming from? Well, states like Michigan and New Jersey both lost seats because people were leaving those states, leaving the more expensive northern and north Midwestern states for lower cost of living in the sunbelt, in these southern, warmer states. So in those examples, we can see that when people move, their populations are changing.
00:04:04
And then that has to be accounted for when we're talking about the different congressional districts. Now how are the districts redrawn? Well, that's done by their state legislatures or by independent commissions, depending on the state. Arizona and Washington use independent commissions. And they do this to create bipartisan representation. Now there is criticism for the states that use their own
00:04:30
legislatures to do this. And what people say is they're doing this to redraw the lines in favor of the party that is currently in power. And the independent commission is used to kind of alleviate some of these concerns. Now redistricting has come under fire in the past. So let's look at some of the ways this has been done and some of the challenges associated with it.
00:04:54
Now illegal redistricting. We're looking at a map of one of the first instances where illegal redistricting was really talked about. We're looking at a map from Massachusetts districts and this creature here is said to resemble the mythical creature of a salamander. And not the little salamanders you think of today, but a much more powerful mythical figure.
00:05:21
Now this is called gerrymandering. The first instance of this. And gerrymandering is the manipulation of voting districts to unfairly favor one political party over the other. And it's illegal in the United States. It was named after the Massachusetts governor Eldridge Gerry.
00:05:38
He signed a new district into law in 1812. And it created the districts that we just saw on that map. It created those districts, which some people said were done to give his political party an advantage. Now many people said, well, this looks like a salamander. And someone joked they should call it a gerrymander. And that's where it got its name, after the Massachusetts governor.
00:06:03
There's something called a racial gerrymandering. And its employees a wasted vote strategy. Essentially what this does is it creates districts in such a way to dilute the number of minority votes within a given district so that representatives who may be more sympathetic to minorities, who may be a minority themselves, aren't going to get elected because the number of minority votes for that district are so
00:06:31
diluted that they're overpowered by a white majority vote. This is used to weaken voting power of minorities. Well, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which you can see President Lyndon Johnson signing, called for an end to these discriminatory voting practices. They outlawed other things that were used to discriminate voting like literacy tests, poll taxes, violence, and
00:06:59
racial gerrymandering. Now one way to use that voting rights law and to kind of create new districts that more fairly represent the population is to create majority-minority districts. Now this is packing district with a majority of minority voters. It's drawn to the dilution of minority voters among several districts.
00:07:30
So you're creating a very powerful district of minority voters. But it's also criticized by some for concentrating minority votes and limiting their overall influence. So what some people say is, OK. That's great. You've concentrated all these minority votes into one area. And as a result, these people have been able to elect a
00:07:52
representative who they wanted. However, it means that in all the other districts majority voters are able to elect who they want. So now you might have an instance of 4:1 where you have four districts electing someone who represents all the majority interests and only one district able to represent someone who represents minority interests. Now one great example of this is the Congressional District
00:08:27
4, which was created in the state of Illinois. And I can highlight that here. This here in the blue is the District 4. Now, many people call it the earmuff district because of the way that it looks. Let's focus on this district. The majority of voters in this district are Latino. And, as a result, they elected Luis Gutierrez as the first
00:08:57
Latino Congressman from the Midwest. Now there are two sides to this. The arguments for doing so is that it empowered Latino voters and provided them representation in Congress. And it also complied with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. So this is why many people said, this is why we drew these boundaries in this way. We wanted to give representation to these Latino
00:09:25
voters and we also wanted to comply with the Voting Rights Act. The arguments against this were that it really diminished the power of Latino voters by concentrating their votes in that one district. So people elsewhere, like we said earlier, they're not getting to vote. So there's still dilution even though they're able to elect a
00:09:48
Latino Congressman, what about these other districts where, still, majority voters have control? And they say that it's basically, again, a form of gerrymandering, which is illegal in the United States. And so this is why oftentimes we see some states, like Arizona and Washington, using that independent commission to kind of get away from some of this political debate. Now just to quickly review this section.
00:10:15
We talked about different districts in the US, the electoral geography and what it was and how it looks at the drawing of these different district boundaries. And then it also looks at the outcome of an election and how the drawing of the boundaries impacts that. We talked about redistricting. We talked about gerrymandering and the creation of majority-minority districts and some of the debate that
00:10:40
goes with those. Whether they are themselves a form of gerrymandering, of racial gerrymandering, or whether they are a way to comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and to get away from racial gerrymandering. So in the next section, we're going to look at enclaves and exclaves, which are also part of internal boundaries within a country.
00:11:01
Thanks so much for joining me this time, and I look forward to seeing you in the next section. Thanks again.

! Section 3
00:00:00
PROFESSOR: Hi. I'm Jane, your instructor. Welcome back to our discussion on geography and internal boundaries. This is section three. Our objective for this section is to differentiate between exclaves, enclaves, and territories as internal units. Remember, you may notice some terms are in bold.
00:00:14
Pay attention to those. They're your vocabulary words. We started off this lesson by talking about internal boundaries and how they're political boundaries within a country. The countries are divided into different administrative units. And these units are there to manage, protect, and control
00:00:32
territory locally. Well, internal boundaries can also be physically separated from a main political unit. So they're still part of that country. It's still essentially an internal boundary, but it's physically separated from that country. These include things like islands, territorial holdings, and enclaves and exclaves.
00:00:51
We're going to talk more about these. So some of the other examples of internal boundaries include territories, autonomous regions, exclaves, and enclaves. So let's look at each one of these in more detail in turn. So what are territories? Looking at this map in front of us, you see lots of different pink lit up.
00:01:10
And you might notice that the eastern seaboard of the United States is in pink. Well, of course, this isn't a recent map. This map is just showing at various times the various territorial holdings of the United Kingdom. You can see Australia and New Zealand, Canada, parts of the United States, countries in Africa and India, and other countries in Asia were once part of the United Kingdom at
00:01:41
various times-- from the 1400s up until as late as the mid-1900s, 1960s, 1970s-- when some of the African nations regained their independence. Well, territories are non-sovereign geographic areas that have come under the control of another country. They're dependent on an external government.
00:02:06
They're often overseas, but sometimes they neighbor a country. Now, the amount of self-rule and self-determination varies among these territories. Sometimes they're self-governing, and sometimes they're under the direct control of another nation. These are less common today than in the past, like we said, since many of these places have now gained
00:02:23
independence. They're independent nations. So we don't see that as much as we did during the Age of Imperialism. Now, occupied territories are land that's occupied by temporary government following a conflict. And they're occupied by a military or provisional government in this conquered territory.
00:02:41
And they have the potential for annexation, where they become part of that country, or independence, where their independence is returned to them. A modern example of this is the Gaza Strip where Israel is the occupying power. The Gaza Strip is a disputed territory between Palestinians and Israelis. And Israel is recognized as the governing power there.
00:03:08
German and Japanese occupations during World War II-- Germans occupied parts of France, for example, and other countries in Europe. Japanese occupied countries in Asia during World War II. Now autonomous regions-- and we can see the autonomous region of Tibet, which is part of China here--
00:03:29
are areas within a country that are given the ability to govern themselves. Now they're not considered their own states by their government. And they're not always be recognized as independent by other countries. So regions that want more independence are often granted this moniker of an autonomous region.
00:03:49
They're allowed to make a certain number of decisions that affect their own people. But other nations often struggle with how to deal with or how to recognize this country because they don't want to upset the main territorial power if you will. So many countries around the world today do not recognize Tibet as an independent nation. They recognize it as just simply the autonomous region
00:04:14
of Tibet still under the control of China. Now exclaves and enclaves-- Well, what an exclave is, it's a portion of a country that's geographically separated from the country's mainland. Kaliningrad, Russia is an example. Alaska fits this example. Sometimes it's considered an exclave and sometimes it isn't.
00:04:34
It really can depend on which geographer you're asking. But it fits the basic definition because it is physically separated by another country from the United States. And Gibraltar, which is located at the very tip of Spain, almost where Spain and Africa meet, there's the Strait of Gibraltar there. And it's separated from the United Kingdom.
00:04:58
Now an enclave is a territory whose boundaries are completely within the boundaries of another country. And these are often independent countries. One of the most cited examples is that of Lesotho, which is located within the boundaries of the country of South Africa, as well as the Vatican City, the Holy See, which is located within the boundaries of Rome. Now why are exclaves and enclaves created?
00:05:25
Well, this can be done for ethnic or cultural differences. For example, the Vatican City was created and set apart as a territory for the Catholic Church, a special territory created for a certain group. It can also be for the safety and protection of resources, access to the ocean, or other natural resources. So you can see that Angola, which you can see in orange on
00:05:53
the map in front of you, has a territory of Cabinda, which is a small exclave. It is physically separated by a small strip. The Democratic Republic of the Congo splits it from Angola. Now it has numerous resources that make it-- its oil reserves in particular-- a valuable resource for Angola. So that's why they have created this exclave.
00:06:21
Now just to quickly review, we talked about a territory. It's a region that's outside of the country that controls it. An occupied territory-- a region that is temporarily controlled by a country after a conflict. An autonomous region, which is a territory that's given partial independence by its country.
00:06:37
An exclave-- a small territory that's physically separated from its country's mainland. And an enclave-- a territory with boundaries that fall completely within another country. Well, in this lesson we talked about the different types of boundaries that exist within a country, these internal
00:06:57
boundaries. In your life you've probably encountered different sets of rules and laws as you cross different boundaries. We said in the United States alone that we have state boundaries, county, city, and intra-city. So as a resident of the United States, the rules aren't always the same depending on where you go. This can be confusing, right?
00:07:20
But it's also understandable. So think a little bit about why these have been established. Do you think that these different types of administrative units make sense? Do we seem to create them for good reasons? Do you think that they're necessary and that they work in the context of the United States?
00:07:37
And then, how about applying that to the rest of the world? So spend some time thinking about that until I see you next time. Thanks so much for joining me, and have a great day.
