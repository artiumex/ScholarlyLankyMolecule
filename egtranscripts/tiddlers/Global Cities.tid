! Section 1
00:00:02
TEACHER: Hi, my name is Kirsten, and I'm your instructor today. So how many products do you own that are made in a foreign country? Well, chances are it's quite a few. Check the labels in your clothing, on the packaging of various products, even on the food that you eat, and chances are you're going to find things made in China, made in
00:00:20
Taiwan, made in Cambodia, or even made in France. No matter where you live, in a big city or a small town, your daily life is influenced by products made elsewhere. On top of that, our culture is also influenced by culture around the world. Our culture's influenced by ideas that come out of other cities different from the ones in which we live. Our music, our literature, our movies, everything is becoming
00:00:48
more and more interconnected. And geographers and historians call this process globalization. And in this lesson, we're going to talk about why this process has occurred and why global cities are so important. This lesson is titled Global Cities. Our objectives, to examine globalization and the creation
00:01:08
of modern global cities, to analyze the qualities of global cities and their effect on the world community, and to analyze the future of rising and declining global cities. In this lesson, we'll be looking at the first objective. And as we go along, some of our words and terms will be highlighted in purple. Pay close attention to those because they're part of your
00:01:29
vocabulary for this lesson. So first, let's take a look at globalization. This is a term that's been in the news a lot lately. You've likely heard it at school before. But what does globalization mean? Well, globalization is talking about all the things that influence your daily life and how, more and more and increasingly, they're coming from outside of our country or
00:01:52
outside of the region or area in which you live. And you can see, globalization affects the products that you buy, the food that you eat, what you watch on TV, the music you listen to, what you think, what you read, what you believe, and even how you spend your time. And we can see all sorts of instances here. We see factories in China that are creating the things that we use.
00:02:17
We see a news report in a foreign country that we might watch on our TV. And we see the interconnectivity that's happening as a result of the internet. So globalization is the process of our world shrinking and becoming more connected. Now you might say, our world is shrinking, what do you mean by that? Well, of course, our world isn't actually shrinking.
00:02:38
It just seems like it is because we perceive the world through time and space. And you have to think about 200 years ago, it took a long time to get to China, it took a long time to get a letter to London. And now both of those trips, both of those things can be done relatively quickly today. So we perceive the size of the world based on how long it
00:03:01
takes to get somewhere, how far away something is, and how quickly can we communicate with someone there. And it's very different today than it was in the 1700s and the 1800s. The improving technology around us makes the world seem like it is getting smaller. For example, media communication creates instant communication.
00:03:23
The telephones that we use, the internet television today, you can pick up a phone, and you can talk to your sister in Europe, you can talk to a business associate in China. And that conversation can be done in real time with a very, very tiny lapse in time between sentences. Nothing compared to the way it was done hundreds of years ago when you had to write a letter, and they would have to send a response back.
00:03:48
And then you could send a response back to them. Think about the difficulty in negotiating a treaty or a business arrangement under those types of circumstances. It was very difficult, it could take weeks, if not months. And today, business leaders can chat via video phone. They can put people all around the world together in one room with cameras attached to their computers, and they can all
00:04:12
talk, make a decision. And it's made the world seem like it's smaller. Next, we have improved transportation. We can actually ship goods much more quickly around the world. Products that are made in Mexico can be in your store in a matter of hours or days, instead of weeks. If you need to go to China for a business trip, it doesn't
00:04:35
take months anymore to get there. It takes a matter of hours. So this improved technology has dramatically altered the way we live our lives, the way we do business, the way we communicate. You can post a video on the internet, and it could be viewed instantaneously by people in a multitude of countries around the world.
00:04:53
So it's really changed the way we live our lives, and it's affected all parts of our life. It's affected our economies, it's affected our culture, it's affected our belief systems. So how is the world more connected? Well, first, the world is connected economically. Cities and regions depend upon each other's products. International banks trade stocks and money globally.
00:05:17
And a stock is a piece of a company that you can buy. So you can buy all types of companies. You can buy American companies, you can buy parts of European countries, you can buy parts of Chinese companies, all of which are traded on global stock markets. Next, we have this cultural connection. Trends and beliefs spread across the globe, and
00:05:40
societies share information and knowledge. And again, it's done instantaneously. A wonderful TV show will be available on the internet in 24 hours for people who live in Europe to watch. You can post a video of something going on in your town that can be viewed by others. International correspondents can bring us events real time whether they're natural disasters, or riots, or
00:06:04
protests, or election results. So we are so connected, trends are going to spread very, very quickly. And people are going to see the same media. They're going to see the same entertainment. They're going to have access to literature, access to political debate. And it affects the world much more quickly than it did in
00:06:26
the past. Finally, we have increased political connections. International organizations unite decision making, and governments form political alliances. So after World War II, for the first time, countries of the world formed an international organization that has sustained itself, that's lasted a long time. The United Nations has been around almost 100 years now,
00:06:51
an organization dedicated to people working together to solve global problems. The European Union, for example, the countries of Europe working together on common economic decisions, common defense decisions in order to cooperate more. So we're seeing the world connect more and more and more each and every year. Our economies are working together.
00:07:13
Our culture is changing in the same ways. American chain restaurants are seen in Russia, they're seen in Europe, they're seen in China. And we're really just seeing our world change very, very quickly and in very profound ways. So let's look at the typical examples of globalization. And the term you would hear most often is called westernization.
00:07:36
This is the global spread of Western European and North American culture and ideas. It's really due, in great part, to the influence of American film and television. It's due in great part to the importance of the American economy and the growth of the American economy. And also, we've seen the spread of European and American forms of government, democratic
00:07:58
ideals around the world. So the westernization of culture and government has been a very important force in recent decades. Now not everyone thinks this is a good thing. There are plenty of people that say, wait a minute, do we really want the same culture everywhere? Do we want the same restaurants on every corner, in every city in the world?
00:08:20
Do we all want to drink the same coffee and eat the same hamburgers? Do we want the same stores around the world? And there's a lot of people that think that's a bad thing, that the diverse cultures we've enjoyed is what makes us great as human beings. And so it's important to note that not everyone thinks that this is the most wonderful thing that's ever happened.
00:08:39
And it's also important to note that there are some drawbacks as a result of this process. Another example of globalization is Easternization. Now this is not as significant or profound as westernization, but I do want to show you at least another example. And Easternization is the spread of East Asian culture and ideas.
00:08:59
So for example, the influence of Japanese business and manufacturing models, the importance of the Chinese economy on the global economy, the worldwide spread of East Asian religions, such as Buddhism, is some of the ways that the Eastern culture has spread as well. So let's take a look at the global cities of the world. Well, global cities are cities at the center of the world's economy, culture, and government.
00:09:27
And I've put some examples of global cities here for you to take a look at. They include Los Angeles, Paris, Brussels, and Hong Kong. Each of these cities is an important force in the global economy and the growth of culture around the world. So let's take a look at global cities and their influence. Global cities, again, are centers of globalization.
00:09:50
They show the global influence on the world's business and behaviors. They are networked heavily with the rest of the world. So they have a great deal of influence in worldwide decision making on economic growth, on trendsetting around the world. And typically, these cities are very wealthy and influential.
00:10:08
So they are located in certain parts of the world more predominately than others. So you wouldn't expect a typical city in Africa, for example, to be a global city because often these are cities that struggle economically. It's far more likely it's going to be in predominantly European, North American, and East Asian cities. So in this lesson, we talked about the growing importance
00:10:34
of globalization. We live in a shrinking world. And even though it's not actually getting smaller in miles, it certainly is getting smaller with regard to transportation and communication. Technology helps the world feel smaller, and again, our world is increasingly connected each and every day. More and more people each year get access to the internet.
00:10:55
The internet has helped ideas spread very, very quickly. Our economies are growing closer and more connected, as well as our cultures and our governments. Secondly, we talked about global cities. These are centers of globalization. These are the cities that are very wealthy, they're very, very influential, and they affect decision making and trends around the world.
00:11:19
So thank you very much, and I'll see you next time. Bye.

! Section 2
00:00:01
TEACHER: Hi, my name is Kirsten, and I'm your instructor today. This lesson is Global Cities. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section, we'll be looking at the second objective, to analyze the qualities of global cities and their effect on the world community. Well, in this lesson we've been learning about
00:00:18
globalization. And the force behind globalization is the influence of certain cities around the world. They have a global influence in all areas of our daily lives, everything from our economies to our governments to also our culture. So what are the qualities of global cities? What are the types of characteristics that we see?
00:00:39
First and foremost, global cities are economic centers. They are centers for trade. They are centers for finance. They are the centers that make the global economy run. Next they are also cultural centers, because these cities tend to be very, very wealthy. They are influential in the spread and transmission of cultural ideas, beliefs,
00:01:00
everything from art and music to entertainment. And then finally, they are governmental centers. These are the cities where the world's important decisions are made with regard to politics, with regard to cooperation, treaties, and the like. So let's take a look at first what is an economic center. Well, global cities that are economic centers are important places for financial decision making.
00:01:26
This can include perhaps being home to many corporate headquarters of multinational corporations. And multinational corporations are companies that do business all around the world, so major banks, major companies, major oil companies, for example. They're home to investment banks, where businesses can go for loans. They invest in business around the world.
00:01:49
And they're also research and development centers. In addition, these cities are home to the biggest financial markets in the world. And remember, a market is a place where things are traded. So in this case we're talking about trading with regard to finance, so insurance, stocks, bonds, and commodities, and the like. So they're home to the world's biggest stock markets, where
00:02:14
pieces of companies are bought and sold, where bonds can be bought and sold, either government bonds, company bonds, or even city and state bonds, and also commodities exchanges. This is where raw materials are bought and sold. So things like oil and cotton and gold. Now let's take a look at some of the most important economic centers around the world.
00:02:36
First we have Wall Street in New York. This is a district of New York City. We can see it's home to the New York Stock Exchange. Next, in the upper right hand corner, and this is Canary Wharf in London, home to some of the most important banks in the world, international banks that invest around the world. In the bottom right hand corner, we have the commodity
00:02:58
trading floor in the city of Chicago. So we see a great deal of trade with regard to gold, oil, and food products, everything from oranges to pork. And then finally, in the bottom left, we see the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the important trading center for East Asia. So next let's take a look at the most important cultural centers around the world.
00:03:23
Now, cultural centers are those that set trends. We're talking about trends in customs, in beliefs, in entertainment, in music, and in behavior. So these are the cities that serve as media and information centers. They're home to television networks, film studios, and news agencies. They're home to the arts.
00:03:44
So cities with important museums and galleries or important artistic communities where art is produced. And also they're important consumption centers. So these are places where people buy and use goods. So fashion centers, shopping spaces, and markets where buyers can go to buy goods for their stores. So let's take a look at some of the most important cultural centers around the world.
00:04:13
In the upper left hand corner, we have the city of New York, which is home to many of the world's important news agencies, important broadcasting networks. When we think about the big broadcasting networks of America, those are very influential because many American TV shows are then shown around the world. They're either translated or dubbed into other languages, or they are produced in English around
00:04:37
the world as well. It's also home to many of the most important music companies in America. And of course, American music is also influential around the world. In the upper right hand corner, we see the Hollywood sign, so we know this is Hollywood and Los Angeles, California, home to a very, very influential film and
00:04:57
entertainment industry, where American television shows, films are produced that are then shown around the world. In the bottom right hand corner, we see the city of Paris. This is taken from the Louvre, the very influential museum, perhaps the greatest museum in the world. It's home to dozens and dozens of museums, as well as a strong artistic tradition that has
00:05:20
influenced global art movements. And finally, the bottom left hand corner, this is a district in Tokyo called Shibuya. This is a very important shopping district. Many important fashion chains have stores in this district. A great deal of money is spent here on everything from clothing to electronics. And Tokyo has a thriving electronics industry, as well.
00:05:48
Next we're going to take a look at government centers. So these are the centers of international policy, where treaties are made, where trade agreements are made, and other important government and political decisions. These cities are home to international governmental organizations, things like the United Nations, regional government agencies like the European Union or the Organization of
00:06:14
American States. They're also home to global policy organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. These organizations make policies that many countries abide by in order to receive funding and help. They're also home to the important non-governmental organizations around the world, so charities and relief organizations such as the International Red Cross and
00:06:39
lobbying organizations that influence national governments around the world. So let's take a look at the important governmental centers around the world. In the upper left hand corner, we have the city of Brussels. It is home to many of the organizations and committees within the European Union. It is home to the various committees within the European
00:07:02
Parliament and also home to NATO, which is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It's the military alliance that the United States as well as many of the countries in Europe belong to. In the upper right hand corner, we see the city of New York, which is home to the United Nations, which is a very important international organization. In the bottom right hand corner, we see the city of
00:07:24
Geneva, Switzerland. It's home to many of the important nongovernmental organizations and relief organizations around the world. The International Red Cross has its headquarters here as well as many of the United Nations agencies. So the relief agency arm of the United Nations as well as the World Health Organization is located in Geneva.
00:07:45
In the bottom left hand corner, we see the headquarters of the International Monetary Fund. It's located in Washington, DC. Washington, DC, of course, is a very influential governmental center, not just because of the United States. But it's also very influential globally. In addition to being home to the IMF, it's home to the World Bank, 174 embassies, as well as the Organization of
00:08:11
American States, a regional organization. So let's take a look at the global cities. Now we're about to take a look at some of the most influential global cities. So these are the ones that are important for many reasons. Primarily they all have a financial aspect. So they're very important finance centers. So they're home to important stock exchanges, important
00:08:33
banking organizations. And they also are influential for other reasons, either culturally or as government headquarters and the like. Of course, these are not the only global centers of importance, but these, again, are leading. And they're in no particular order. Not one is more important. And of course, this list could always change.
00:08:53
Some cities are growing in influence, and others are not having as much influence as they did a few years ago. But first is New York City. New York City, of course, is very important with regard to finance in addition to being home to the world's largest stock market. It is also home to many important banks as well as culturally, especially with regard to news organizations
00:09:16
around the world. Next we have the city of London. It's an important finance and banking city. We have the city of Paris. In addition to having banking and finance, it's also known for its importance with regard to culture and fashion. And then finally, the city of Tokyo, which is growing in importance.
00:09:36
It's a very important trade center, especially in East Asian markets, as well as an important city of global finance. So in this section, we talked about global cities and how they influence the world. First they are centers of economics. They are the home to the financial markets and multinational corporate headquarters of companies
00:09:57
around the world. They are centers of culture. They are home to influential companies with regard to media, arts, as well as consumption. Important trade is done in these cities. People buy a lot in these cities. And finally, they are centers of government. They are headquarters of governmental and aid
00:10:17
organizations, everything from the United Nations to the World Health Organization and the International Red Cross. So thank you very much, and I'll see you next time. Bye.

! Section 3
00:00:01
TEACHER: Hi. Welcome back. This lesson is Global Cities. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section we will be looking at our third objective, to analyze the future of rising and declining global cities. Well one type of global city that we see that is growing in importance is called the emerging global city.
00:00:20
And emerging is a term that economists and geographers use to describe an area that is growing in importance, especially economic importance. And these particular cities are enjoying rapid economic development, so this means new innovation, new ideas, centers for research and development, and new approaches to economic growth. Now often these cities also are centers of regional
00:00:45
economic leadership, so they're the most important city in their areas. All the goods coming in and out of Southeast Asia might go through this particular city. Or all the goods coming in and out of Africa might go through this particular city. So that's one way we can tell that a city is perhaps an emerging global city.
00:01:04
They connect a region to the rest of the world and they often are used to attract businesses from other regions. Because what we've seen happen as our world has grown more connected, we have new markets that are growing in importance. A great example would be China. It has a rising middle class, a lot more money. And so lots of companies are trying to get
00:01:25
their goods into China. So they pick some of these emerging global cities in which to do business. So great example of an emerging global city is Shenzhen, China. This is one of the fastest growing cities in the world. And again it's serving as that regional economic center in that particular part of China.
00:01:43
So lots of goodS traveling in and out of that city, lots of international companies and corporations doing business in this city, again because of that growing importance of the Chinese market. So let's take a look at Shenzhen. It again is an emerging global city, rapidly growing. And again an emerging global city is one that's rapidly growing in a developing country.
00:02:05
This particular city, Shenzhen, is a leading port and manufacturing center in China. Now one reason it's done so well economically is that China has set up something called a special economic zone. This is an area with simpler regulations to encourage economic investment, so the laws and rules that apply to most of China do not apply in this particular area.
00:02:27
They've made it easier for international businesses to come in and do business there. They've made regulations much easier for them to comply with. The tax laws and so-forth are much simpler. And again it's strictly for the purpose of encouraging lots and lots of international investment in this particular area.
00:02:46
Now on the other side of things, we have struggling global cities. So for every city in the developing world that's really growing in prominence, that's an emerging global city, we have lots of cities however that are not making that transition. So what are the characteristics of a city that is perhaps struggling?
00:03:05
Well we see this often in the developing world. So we have developing and underdeveloped cities. Often what happens is residents in these cities lack access to common needs, things like water, education, employment, and so-forth, and as a result they typically have a lower quality of life, lower life expectancy, lower literacy rates. They also typically have unequal access to finance and
00:03:31
the economy. So what happens is you do have this very wealthy group of individuals but it's usually a small part of the population. That wealthy group of businesses and individuals is likely doing business in the global market, but the average citizen in this city is not. As well we typically have unequal distributions of income, so we have a whole lot of money in the hands of a
00:03:54
very small percentage of the population while the vast majority of people living in this city are very, very poor. We also typically have unequal services, especially things like education. So we often see lower literacy rates, much lower high school graduation rates. And what happens is that cycle of poverty continues and continues.
00:04:13
Because we understand that for people to get out of poverty, you know they need a good education. They need access to training to find a good job to break that cycle, and it's very, very difficult. So let's take a look at a city that's struggling with inequality, and that's Johannesburg, South Africa. And we can see the difference if we look at the pictures on the top with those on the bottom.
00:04:34
We see on the top something that looks very, very modern, very nice housing developments, nice apartment buildings. And then on the bottom we see a shanty town on the left. We see some prefabricated homes here on the right. So we can see that these groups of people, the ones that live in the city on the top and the ones that live in the city on the bottom, these different areas of the same
00:04:57
city, we have a great deal of inequality. So let's talk about Johannesburg. Johannesburg is highly segregated. It's one of the world's most unequal global cities, divided by not only race but also income. And of course South Africa had that legacy of apartheid where people who were not white had one set of rules, one set of opportunities.
00:05:19
And then the white people of course ran the government, did all the business, had the good schools, and so-forth. And so even though apartheid is gone, the inequality is a continuing problem because it takes a long time to get the rest of the residents up to that middle class that most white South Africans enjoy. So the government is seeking solutions to diminish economic disparity.
00:05:44
They're investing in poor neighborhoods, building schools, bringing electricity, and so-forth, because they do understand that their economy cannot thrive if a huge portion of the people living there don't have money to buy goods. Because we understand for economies to grow, people have to have money to spend. And the economy works much better if everyone has money,
00:06:03
because that means we'll produce more. We will be able to sell more and so-forth. So the government does recognize that and they are trying to take steps to alleviate that problem. In addition, Johannesburg is a regional economic center, so this is a global city. Lots of goods go in and out of this particular city before they travel throughout the rest of Africa.
00:06:24
It's A very important city with regard to manufacturing, especially automobile manufacturing. So again this does tie Southern Africa to the world's economy. Now another reason a global city might be struggling is because of outsourcing and industry loss. So sometimes when a city is heavily dependent upon one industry, if that industry begins to fail or if those
00:06:46
jobs start to go away, we really start to see this city began to struggle. Outsourcing is when jobs are exported across borders. And so what we often see in these types of cities, especially more recently with computers and mechanization and so-forth, is that manufacturing and service jobs move across borders because they can be done cheaper elsewhere.
00:07:06
This has been a big problem here in America. Multinational corporations are seeking better profits. They want lower labor costs. And now because of technology and satellites and the cheap cost of communication, there's no reason why if you need to pick up your phone and talk to your airline you can't do it with someone who lives in a country far, far away. So as a result these cities tend to start to decay.
00:07:29
We start to see urban blight. We see increased unemployment and decreased investment in these cities. So here's a great example of a city that's undergoing this. This is Detroit, Michigan, and we can see this is a city that is starting to decay. It used to be a very important global city. It was the center of automobile
00:07:48
production of the world. In the early 1900's, the auto industry was very, very important, and they had a booming economy for decades. But starting in the 1980's, Detroit begins to downturn. More imported cars are competing with American cars. More American production is being taken out of the country. And so again this accelerated globalization caused
00:08:13
manufacturing jobs to leave the city for points across borders. As a result we have urban decay and rising unemployment. So in review, we talked about emerging global cities. Those are those cities that are becoming more and more important economically. They're centers of manufacturing and trade. And they're those regional centers of development.
00:08:33
They often have that rapid innovative economic growth. And the example we used was Shenzhen, China. Then we also see cities that are struggling. These often were once very prominent global cities that are starting to decay or they're cities that are not enjoying the development they enjoyed earlier. Outsourcing and industry loss is a cause of this, and we saw that with Detroit, Michigan.
00:08:56
So in review, we talked about the growing importance of global cities, and the role these cities might play in your life. So I'd like you to take a few minutes and think about that. What kind of goods do you use and buy that are not made here in America but they are made in cities far, far away? What about your clothing and shoes? And I'd like you to think about maybe what's going to
00:09:16
happen in the future. Do you think this trend is going to continue or do you think perhaps maybe this trend will not and maybe more manufacturing will be done here in America? And also what steps do you think leaders of our country should take in order to encourage economic growth in our own cities? Thanks so much, and I'll see you next time.
00:09:37
Bye.
