! Section 1

00:00:01
PROFESSOR: Hi, my name is Kiersten. And I'm your instructor today. How many boundaries do you see on a daily basis? Maybe your home is surrounded by a fence in the backyard. You might cross from one town into another on your way to school. What other boundaries do you typically utilize or see? Maybe when you go to the movie theater if the movie's going
00:00:22
to be especially popular, sometimes we're forced to line up between those little velvet ropes. Sometimes doorways can have boundaries. There are signs explaining, please do not enter. Boundaries are a part of our daily life. And I'd like you to just take a moment and think about the number of boundaries that you crossed today. You likely left the boundary of your home when you left
00:00:42
through the front door. You left your family's property or building. And perhaps you crossed onto private property when you arrived at work. Or you crossed onto school grounds when you came to school today. We see boundaries all the time around us. And studying boundaries is a very
00:00:58
important part of geography. And in this lesson we're going to learn about the different types of boundaries, and how they affect you in your daily life. This lesson is titled, Territory and Boundaries in Geography. Our objectives, to examine concepts in political geography, and then identify the ways space is organized
00:01:16
into states. To compare and contrast nations and states as political constructs. And to examine how boundaries are created through physical geography, geometry, and conflict. In this lesson we'll be looking at our first objective. And as we go along some of our words and terms will be
00:01:33
highlighted in purple. Pay close attention, because they're part of your vocabulary for this lesson. Well, political geography is the study of all aspects of government organizations in the world. So we're looking at the boundaries of countries. We're looking at the governments of countries and the like.
00:01:51
It studies boundaries. It studies various countries and the aspects of their countries. It studies how countries develop. And it studies the way they interact with each other through international and internal politics. It also studies political organizations, how regions are organized, how city government is organized, how national
00:02:11
government is organized. And a very important part of political geography are boundaries, such as this fence line, which separates the city of Tijuana, Mexico from the United States. What is a boundary? A boundary is a line that surrounds territory under control by a person or group in power. Now sometimes boundaries are tangible.
00:02:34
They are actual physical barriers, actual lines that you can see that explain where one property or one country begins and where one ends. So this includes things like fences, walls, and rivers. Now intangible boundaries are those types of boundaries that you can't see. They're imaginary boundaries. Sometimes when you go from one state to another on a rural
00:02:59
road there may not even be a sign to let you know you've entered a new state. Personal space is a boundary that's important to all of us. But there's no actual line that surrounds us that says, oh, don't cross this line. So there's all kinds of boundaries. Boundaries that we see on maps. Boundaries that are simply signs that tell us don't go
00:03:18
any further than this point. They're fences, they're ropes, they're sidewalks. Imagine if someone were to walk by your house, and instead of staying on the sidewalk, they started walking through your yard. Well, they're encroaching on your boundary. And you likely wouldn't like it. So boundaries are all around us.
00:03:35
And there's all kinds of boundaries. And we're going to take a look at some of those types of boundaries in this section of this lesson. So why do we even have boundaries? Let's take a look at this. This is a barren part of Antarctica. This is, interestingly, a very, very dry area of Antarctica that is not covered in snow and ice.
00:03:53
It never gets precipitation. It looks pretty barren. And why would anyone want to claim this territory? Well, countries around the world are fighting over Antarctica, even though it may not seem like it's very important, or people don't really need it, or want it. The reason is territoriality. And this is just this idea that people have. I have my
00:04:14
territory and I'm going to protect it. And it's this human nature aspect of us. It probably goes back to when people competed with each other for food and resources. So territoriality is, again, a desire to control or influence an area or people. And, again, it's an instinct. It's an instinct with us as individuals.
00:04:35
It's also our instinct with a group. And, again, we're trying to control access to what we perceive as ours. And we're trying to provide safety. We want to keep our area safe for ourselves and for our families. So let's take a look at the way we show what our territory is.
00:04:52
We do this with our boundaries. First, imagine you. Then you have your personal space. And you're always in your personal space. And if someone invades your personal space, and it's not necessary, we can feel very, very uncomfortable. Next we have our private property. So whenever you're in a place of business, whenever you're
00:05:11
in your home, whenever you're in an apartment, you're on your private property. You're likely also part of some kind of political boundary, either your city, or your state, or your country. So all of the time, we're in many different types of boundaries. We're within the boundaries of our country. We're in the boundary of our state.
00:05:29
We're in the boundary of our personal space at all times. So how do we establish boundaries? Well, imagine you're in an elevator. And you're in the elevator by yourself. And it stops at a floor and someone gets in. Where would you expect that person to stand? Well, probably over there, in that corner. You'd feel very uncomfortable if they came and stood right
00:05:49
next to you when it wasn't necessary. Or imagine you go to the movie theater and it's not very crowded. You're going to take a seat somewhere. And you're likely not going to sit directly by someone. You're going to leave at least one seat between you and the person whom you don't know. And if someone came in, and you were the only one in the
00:06:05
movie theater, and another party came in and they sat right beside you, it would likely give you the creeps. We don't like that. Americans have a very set idea of what our personal space is. And because we're not densely populated, it's pretty big, especially when we compare it to other countries of the world. So, again, our personal space is the comfortable area
00:06:25
surrounding a person. And often we protect that personal space. Look at this girl on the train. She's carrying her purse. But imagine if the train started to get a little bit more crowded. She might place her bag on the seat next to her to discourage someone from sitting directly by her.
00:06:41
Different cultures, again, may have different personal space boundaries. In America, we typically stand between two and four feet from someone if we're speaking to them, depending on how well we know them. That's pretty common. In other cultures, it's very different. When I was a young person, I lived in Japan for a while.
00:07:00
And it's very densely populated in Japan. And it was nothing for somebody to come stand right up next to me on the train or something. And it used to make me very uncomfortable. Especially because it didn't seem like it was necessary. You could stay a little bit further away. But personal space and how we view personal space is very much related to our culture.
00:07:18
And you'll notice if you ever travel abroad, you could see different examples of this. So next time you're in an elevator, or in a movie theater, just take a look and see what happens. And you'll see this principle in action. And people do it very unconsciously. They're not thinking about, when they walk in an elevator, where they're going to stand.
00:07:36
They just happen to do it. And we all obey those principles, because they're part of our ingrained culture. So next we see a boundary here. There's all kinds of boundaries. They come in all sizes. Sometimes we have actual physical barriers like this fence.
00:07:51
There's also a notice saying no trespassing. So often in private property we also know that there are boundaries. Even if there's no actual physical boundary, we know we just don't go play in our neighbor's yard if we don't know them very well. Or we don't go to the street across the way and then go play in that yard.
00:08:08
Because that's not what we do. We don't infringe on people's personal property if we don't have a reason to do so. So, again, private property is an area owned and controlled by a person or group. And, again, it limits access. We only walk into a store if we plan on purchasing something.
00:08:26
We don't walk into a doctor's office if we don't have an appointment just to read the magazines. That would be an infringement on that doctor's personal property. We also seek safety, often by putting fences up, by putting doors on our homes with locks, in order to keep ourselves and our personal property secure. It protects our possessions.
00:08:47
It protects our family from harm. So next let's take a look at political boundaries. And we can see, this is a political map and it shows political boundaries. The purpose of this map is to show the boundaries of countries like the United States, Canada, Brazil, and the like. So why are political boundaries important?
00:09:07
Well, they define political limits. And it shows the limitations of the influence of a government. And the reason that's important is, for example, all governments don't have the same laws. So if I were to cross from Texas into Oklahoma, if I go north from Texas into Oklahoma, I would cross a river, the Red River.
00:09:25
I'd cross a bridge. And then the laws of Oklahoma would be in effect. Oklahoma probably has different speed limits than Texas does. It has different requirements for doing business. It has different requirements to become a teacher, or a doctor, or some other certificate. And so whenever we cross from one boundary into another, now
00:09:43
we have a new government that we have to deal with. If we go from one school district to another, we might have different graduation requirements. So whenever we cross boundaries, it's going to affect our life, with regard to the types of laws and rules that we have to follow. So in review, we learned about why we study boundaries. And boundaries are important to political geography.
00:10:05
In political geography we study governments and their boundaries. And, again, boundaries exist in many forms and sizes. But every human experience also typically involves boundaries. We have personal space boundaries. And we get very uncomfortable if someone violates those. We have private property boundaries.
00:10:24
Again, we protect our own homes with locks on our doors. We have fences around our homes to protect our private property and our backyard. And then also political boundaries are important because that tells us when one set of laws is no longer in effect. And when we have to be concerned about obeying a new set of laws.
00:10:42
So thank you very much. And I'll see you next time.

! Section 2
00:00:00
PROFESSOR: Hi, I'm Jane, your instructor. Welcome back to our discussion on "Territory and Boundaries in Geography." This is Section Two. Our objective for this section is to compare and contrast nations and states as political constructs. Remember, you may notice some terms are in bold. Pay close attention to those. They're your vocabulary words.
00:00:19
Nations. A nation is a group of people sharing common qualities, and these include a common history, a common ethnicity, and a common culture. So they come from a similar history. They're a similar ethnic group. They have that in common. They have a common culture.
00:00:35
This can include things like their religion. It can include their language. It can include certain cultural practices that they partake in. When we're talking about creating states, we're talking about two important pieces of this pie, territoriality and political boundaries. These equal a state.
00:00:55
So states have defined boundaries, and they control a distinct territory. The state is a politically organized and governed space. So states and nations can be the same thing, but they are not always the same thing. So it's important to note that distinction. A state has a defined territory with physical, tangible boundaries.
00:01:20
It's a territory with a political body or government, and it's usually recognized as sovereign. So a nation can exist inside a state, but it's also possible for a nation to exist without a state. So let's look at the difference. The big difference is sovereignty. A state is not subject to the control or power of any other state.
00:01:43
It has a level of recognition by the international community. It's recognized by its neighbors, and it's recognized by the United Nations. A nation can be different from a state, like we said. A nation can exist within a state, but it can also exist without a state. So let's look at Taiwan.
00:02:00
Taiwan was founded as a separate state after World War II. After a civil war in China, the democratic party fled to the island of Taiwan and established itself as the Republic of China. The Communists, who won the civil war in China, established the Chinese mainland as the People's Republic of China.
00:02:25
Taiwan believes it's a sovereign nation. China believes that Taiwan is a rogue province. Fellow nations disagree on whether or not to recognize Taiwan, and it can be complicated. Because, for example, the United States does not want to upset one of its most important economic trading partners, with China, it does not currently recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation.
00:02:51
Taiwan calls itself the Republic of China, like we said, but it competes in the Olympics as Chinese Taipei. And that is because other nations do not recognize it as sovereign, which, remember, we said that that was one of the criteria points for status as a state. We also have a multinational state. This is a state with more than one nation living within its borders.
00:03:16
And a great example of this is the former country of Yugoslavia, which was once one of the Communist countries in Europe. It included some of the nationalities or ethnicities as Slovaks, Croats, and the Serbs. All lived in Yugoslavia. This caused a great deal of tension and conflict among these people.
00:03:39
And we saw that between 1991 and 2000, there was a breakup of former Yugoslavia into these distinct countries that exist today. And that was part and parcel of the ethnic tensions that went on in that country, tensions among groups that created a series of civil wars. We said that a nation can exist in a state, and a state and a nation can be one.
00:04:07
We also saw that a state can have multiple different nationalities living in it. But there are also things called stateless nations, and these are nations and peoples without an official state government. Some great examples of those are the Basques, who live in the borderlands between Spain and France, Palestinians, who live in the occupied territories that border
00:04:30
Israel, and the Kurds. And the Kurds take up an area, Kurdistan, that is in parts of Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. And all of these groups have faced different struggles in trying to create their own distinct nation. They've often been subject to discrimination, to having a lack of control, and to oppression. So they are not in control of some of the big decisions that
00:04:57
are made by the state government that actually will affect them. So that's why many of these people are fighting, and some are actually turning to violence and to terrorism, to try to gain control for themselves. There also have been accounts of genocide. For example, under the leadership of Saddam Hussein, Iraq turned its focus on a genocide of the Kurds living
00:05:25
in parts of Iraq. Just to quickly review this section, nations are a group of people sharing common qualities, while states are a politically organized and governed space. States require sovereignty, which is a main component of it. We saw that there are multinational states, and we also saw that there are stateless nations.
00:05:47
Thanks so much for joining me. I hope that you learned a lot, and I hope that you have a great day.

! Section 3
00:00:02
PROFESSOR: Hi. My name is Kirsten, and I'll be your instructor today. This lesson is Territory and Boundaries in Geography. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here. And in this section, we'll be looking at the third objective, to examine how boundaries are created through physical geography, geometry, and conflict. Well, in this lesson, we've been learning about territory.
00:00:22
How we make our territory sovereign, how we show others where our boundaries are. And in this lesson, we're going to take a look at how boundaries change, how we use geographic barriers to draw boundaries, and how sometimes, we even use geometry and coordinates to draw boundaries. So first, let's take a look at physical boundaries. Often, the best choice for a boundary is a natural barrier.
00:00:46
And this is a picture of the Rio Grande. This is the boundary between the United States and Mexico. So we can see often rivers are chosen to be boundaries between two countries because it's a natural fit. It's just a good dividing line. People automatically know when they've moved from one country into another or from one state to another. So physical boundaries are common choices for boundaries
00:01:11
between states, or between regions. Often, rivers or lakes are chosen. And sometimes, mountains and valleys are chosen. And we're going to take a look on this slide about when a mountain range is chosen as a physical boundary. These are the Pyrenees Mountains. It's a mountain range that separates France from Spain. They form, again, a good natural boundary.
00:01:36
And so, the line was chosen across this mountain range to show the difference between France, which is located here, and then Spain, which is located here. The mountain range, as you can see here on the satellite photo, provides a natural barrier between these two states. Next, let's take a look at geometric boundaries. Sometimes we choose lines of latitude, lines of longitude,
00:02:02
as boundaries. These are often negotiated between countries who both want to claim the same territory. Coordinate-based boundaries are sometimes called geometric boundaries. They're lines of latitude and longitude used to calculate straight boundary lines. Now this particular line of latitude here between the
00:02:21
United States and Canada-- this is 49 degrees latitude. And this was chosen because this territory here was under conflict between Great Britain and the United States at the time Canada was under the control of Great Britain. And both sides both claimed this territory. So as a way of dividing it, they just chose the middle. We'll choose this line of latitude.
00:02:45
You can take what's to the north. We'll take what's to the south. And that prevented conflict between the two nations. So geometric boundaries are often used, especially here in the United States. This goes back to Thomas Jefferson, when he was trying to decide the best way to add states to union when they were starting to explore into the new territory as it was
00:03:09
becoming settled. So states like Ohio and Minnesota-- that part of the country, the Midwest. He came up with an idea of 36 square mile townships, which meant we would use six mile by six miles rectangles or squares in order to divide up that new territory. So we see a lot of geometric boundaries in The United States, especially when you look at the Midwest and points
00:03:33
further West. So in this case, we have the state of Wyoming. And we can see, we have two lines of longitude that form the eastern and western boundaries of Wyoming. And we can also see lines, geometric straight lines, used to divide up Wyoming into the various counties. Now sometimes, boundaries change through war and conflict.
00:03:55
And one area that has changed through conflict is the Sinai Peninsula. The Sinai Peninsula is this area here. And at times, it's been a part of Israel, which is located here. And in recent times, it's a part of Egypt, which is located here. So let's take a look at how this occurs.
00:04:14
Sometimes, boundaries change, either through war or threat of war. And countries sometimes forcefully take new territory from neighbors. So let's take a look at the Israel and Egypt and again, the Sinai peninsula. In 1967, this is the boundary between Egypt and Israel. But in 1967, a war was fought, the Six Day War.
00:04:35
And then, the new territory line was here. So all of the Sinai Peninsula then was claimed by Israel. And again, in their peace treaty that ended that war, Egypt was forced to cede that territory. Well, then another war was fought in 1973, the Yom Kippur War. And then, in the treaty that ended that in 1978, we see the line was returned to its original location.
00:05:01
The Sinai Peninsula went back to Egypt. And this is the dividing line between Israel and Egypt today. So let's take a look at another way that boundaries change. Sometimes, it's through annexation. An annexation means that we are annexing territory. We're taking territory that used to be sovereign or
00:05:20
independent, and we're making it part of our nation. And this happened in Texas. Texas had fought a war with Mexico. Texas gained its independence, and then about a decade later, decided that they wanted to become part of the United States. So Texas was annexed by the United States in 1845. Now annexation is not necessarily celebrated by all.
00:05:43
There were people in Texas who wanted to remain independent. But a vote was taken, and people voted for annexation. This also caused conflict between the United States and Mexico. Mexico was very unhappy with the United States' decision to annex Texas, and it's later going to lead to conflict between Texas and Mexico. The next way that a territory can be acquired is that,
00:06:10
sometimes, it's acquired by purchase. So sometimes, countries buy territory from other countries. The United States acquired Alaska this way. They also acquired the Louisiana Purchase. That this big chunk of America here. It was bought from France in 1803. And it almost doubled the size of the United States.
00:06:34
So in review, we talked about how boundaries are created. Sometimes, they're created through physical geography by taking natural barriers between areas in order to form those boundaries. Sometimes, it's rivers or mountain ranges, valleys or lakes. Sometimes through geometry. We might choose lines of latitude or longitude to
00:06:53
create a boundary. Or we sometimes might split territories down the middle and just choose a dividing line that seems equitable to both. And then sometimes, boundaries are created through conflict. Wars and threats of conflicts often lead to boundary changes. So in this lesson, we've learned all about boundaries.
00:07:12
Why do we have boundaries? Why are humans so territorial? Why do we feel a need to create all of these lines to define our personal space, our private property? Sometimes they're beneficial. Boundaries can help us organize people more efficiently. But again, sometimes, boundaries are caused by
00:07:29
conflict and war. So I'd like you to think about all of the different types of boundaries that you encounter. And again, why are those boundaries there? Do you think they're necessary? And do you sometimes think that humans are too territorial? Maybe we have too many boundaries
00:07:42
than we actually need. And why do you think this occurs? So thank you very much. And I'll see you next time.
