! Section 1

    00:00:00 TEACHER: In this lesson, we're working to answer the question, how do humans and their environment affect one another? So far, we've discussed a few ways how humans adapt to their environment. We'll answer the lesson question as we learn more about how humans and the environment
    00:00:18 affect one another. First, let's continue our discussion about how the environment affects humans.

! Section 2

    00:00:00 TEACHER: Humans and the environment affect one another in a cycle. The environment forces humans to adapt and make choices. In turn, human behavior and choices affect the environment, and so on. So environment is a general term that describes the interactions of organisms,
    00:00:18 climate, and landscape in a given area. The environment will be different from place to place. And humans adapt to different environments in order to survive. Human activity affects the environment. This Cliff Palace in Mesa Verde in southwest Colorado shows how humans created a settlement that uses the cliff as protection from the environment.
    00:00:44 You will think about how humans adapt to the environment. Humans adapt to the environment in which they live in order to survive. Resources are natural features that humans use to live and survive. Resources can be renewable or nonrenewable. Now, some resources can be renewable, such as trees and water.
    00:01:08 Resources can also be nonrenewable, such as coal. Different environments have different natural resources for humans to use. This image is a adobe house in western Texas. Now, desert areas do not have a lot of trees, which means there isn't a lot of wood available for building homes. So humans in desert areas started building homes out
    00:01:34 of adobe, which is a heavy clay soil that has been dried to make bricks. Humans adapted to their environment by using the materials available. The availability of natural resources affected how and where humans decided to live. In history, the availability of physical resources
    00:01:57 often decided whether a human settlement was successful. Now, settlement is an area where people make land livable for humans for the first time. Cities typically developed near rivers, lakes, or ocean ports because waterways. This provided access to food and drink, it allowed for trade and transportation, and it enriched soils for farming.
    00:02:24 This satellite image shows the area surrounding the Nile River. Now, note the skinny stretch right here of green. Now, this is the fertile land in an area that is otherwise all sand and desert. Other important natural resources are materials used to build homes, such as trees and good soil to be able to grow food.
    00:02:53 For example, New Orleans, Louisiana, grew into an important city because of its proximity to the mouth of the Mississippi River, where the river flows into another, the Gulf of Mexico. This has long been a main shipping route for the United States. So there are some of the resources that you can see or can infer from this image.
    00:03:16 We have the river. We have trees. We also have fish. So some economic resources would be buildings, cranes, ships, shipping containers. Some of the social resources, which aren't really visible, but you can kind of see that people would be working in the shipyard,
    00:03:37 or people working in the offices in the buildings. You will describe factors that affected human settlement.

! Section 4

    00:00:00 TEACHER: In addition to resources affecting how and where humans settled, climate and weather also affected human settlements. Climate is the average weather conditions in an environment over time. Humans must adapt to the climate where they live. And living conditions vary greatly
    00:00:20 in hot climates and cold climates. This Inuit family is bundled in animal skins and fur to protect against the cold weather in the Arctic. Humans also modify their living conditions to help make living in extreme climates more comfortable. One example of how humans have modified their environment is by inventing air conditioning. Air conditioning is a technology that helps people
    00:00:48 regulate indoor temperatures. In the 20th century, air conditioning made life in hot climates much more comfortable. This helped cities in the south and southwest United States grow faster than before. This neighborhood was built in the desert in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Analyze the photo and think about how
    00:01:10 modifications like air conditioning made the building of this neighborhood possible. Weather would be too hot for most people. Air conditioning allows people to stay cool and comfortable during the extreme midday desert heat. Many people would choose not to live here if they did not have air conditioning. In addition to adapting to climates,
    00:01:34 humans must adapt to extreme weather conditions. Natural hazards are events that cause dangerous conditions for humans. Extreme weather conditions create natural hazards. And extreme weather events can be caused by natural changes on Earth. When extreme events occur, such as unusual weather conditions, but do not cause harm to humans, it is not considered a hazard.
    00:02:00 There are many different types of natural hazards that affect humans. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, cause damage with their high winds. People must protect themselves and their property from these natural hazards if they live in an environment where hazards are a problem.
    00:02:23 Floods from events such as hurricanes or heavy downpour, heavy rainfalls can affect people, buildings, and crops. Events in the Earth, such as earthquakes or volcanoes, can affect humans. Droughts or long periods of time without rain can lead to large fires spreading uncontrollably. Because of natural hazards, humans
    00:02:51 adapt how they live in order to prepare for these events. They plan. So they prepare to prevent damage to their communities and their properties. They survive. They take steps to keep themselves and others safe during a natural hazard. And they recover.
    00:03:10 They rebuild damaged property. They replace lost goods. And they adapt to survive the next hazard. Humans make adjustments in order to survive natural hazards. So in the future, based on lessons learned from past hazards-- so for example, cities will change building codes after an earthquake or will rebuild houses higher
    00:03:34 after a flood. Major natural disasters or hazards affect people all over the world. Here we see some flooding that was caused when Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, Texas in 2017. The hurricane dumped 16 inches of rain on the city and the surrounding areas of Texas
    00:03:59 in a 24-hour period. Analyze the photo and think about some of the impacts caused by this natural hazard-- houses flooded, people injured or killed, personal belongings ruined. Next, you'll describe the effects of a natural hazard.

! Section 6

    00:00:00 TEACHER: In this lesson, we are working to answer the question, How do humans and their environment affect one another? So far, we've discussed how the environment affected human settlement patterns and how natural hazards affect humans. We'll continue to answer the lesson question
    00:00:17 as we learn more about how human modifications affect the environment.

! Section 7

    00:00:00 TEACHER: There are many ways humans change the environment. Here are a few common ways humans impact the environment which can affect available resources. Human impacts include cutting down trees, building roads, building dams, and farming the land. Resources can be grouped into three main categories. The availability of three main types of resources
    00:00:28 influence where people settle. We have social resources. Include people who work in fields that provide services. Are also called human resources. We have physical resources. They are drawn from the environment and provide humans with materials to survive. We've got economic resources.
    00:00:53 They include artificial products and materials. They become more important as settlements become more advanced. So note that social resources are also called human resources, and the money used to pay for economic resources is often called capital.

! Section 9

    00:00:00 TEACHER: These resources can cause people to settle or move to one area over another, and this affects population. Population growth causes an area's environment to change. People modify or make changes to their natural environment to create livable environments. Those changes affect waterways, plants, and animals. As areas become more livable, the population increases.
    00:00:29 Increased population puts a strain on the amount of available natural resources. Humans create waste that has to go somewhere, and waste affects plants and animals. As we've already learned, humans adapt to their environment, but they also modify the environment with their behaviors and choices. Population growth is one human behavior
    00:00:53 that affects the environment. Humans use resources. Some natural resources, such as oil, could be completely used up if we continue to use them at the current rate. Humans make rules to manage the use of resources. Humans rapidly use resources for convenience. So if resources run out before they are renewed--
    00:01:18 and some resources cannot be renewed at all. As a part of their plan to protect themselves, humans create ways to modify the environment in order to minimize the damage caused by natural hazards. Humans make changes to the environment to lessen the impacts of those natural hazards. Humans build dams and barriers to stop floods.
    00:01:45 This changes habitats above and below the dam or changes the routes of the river. Humans cut down trees to prevent forest fires from spreading. This changes naturally wooded areas. Remember, the environment forces humans to adapt. As a result, humans modify the environment. The modification cycle between humans and the environment has both positive and negative effects.
    00:02:18 The positive effects is the conservation of land. Conservation is the act of preserving or protecting. Also, saving of endangered species. There are negative effects-- pollution of the environment, deforestation of wooded areas and rain forests, spreading of cities in areas that used to be natural areas. When humans modify the environment,
    00:02:46 it can have effects that are not immediately visible. Modifications in one particular area can also affect a different area and even a far distant area. The Hoover Dam is an example of a human modification to an environment that has had positive and negative effects. This photograph shows the Hoover Dam, which was built in the Colorado River. The damming of the river created Lake Mead.
    00:03:18 Water goes into the dam and turns turbines which creates electricity. The Hoover Dam restricts the flow of the Colorado River, so the dam is used to generate electricity, supply drinking water, and control flooding. The dam creates one of the largest human made lakes upstream. The dam also creates a loss of animal habitat downstream.
    00:03:46 It changes the nutrients and sediment downstream as well. Think about which impacts are positive and which are negative. You will explain how modification affects the environment.

! Section 12

    00:00:00 TEACHER: In this lesson, we are working to answer the question, how do humans and their environment affect one another? So far, we've discussed how the environment affects humans and how humans affect the environment. We'll continue to answer the lesson question as we learn more about environmental issues caused
    00:00:19 by human activity.

! Section 13

    00:00:00 TEACHER: The human environment interaction is a two-part relationship. The environment affects behavior which causes humans to modify the environment. The modified environment then causes new issues to arise, which, in turn, affects human behavior. For example, humans want to grow crops
    00:00:24 in an area that does not get a lot of rain. They modify the environment by creating an irrigation system that takes water from a local river. However, the water used for this irrigation system lowers the water levels of the river, which causes farms downriver to not have enough water for their crops. As a result, the farms downriver have
    00:00:47 to come up with a plan to modify their environment further to be able to grow their crops. So, however, in many cases humans simply adapt with changing the environment. While the modifications that humans make may improve lives in the short-term, the modifications may have long-term negative effects. Human behavior and adaptations can
    00:01:13 have negative effects on the local, regional, or global environments. This is pollution, deforestation, which is the cutting down or getting rid of all the forests in one area at a rapid rate, urban sprawl-- this is the spread of a city to the surrounding areas that had few people living there, which
    00:01:37 results in natural areas being converted to neighborhoods-- introduction of non-native species, and the overuse of resources. The negative effects affect human lives in different ways. The environmental issues can have a variety of negative impacts. The first is social. This affects people's health, comfort, recreation,
    00:02:06 and happiness. We have political. This can affect government policy and relationships with neighbors. We've got geographic. This can affect land, water, air, and other species that share the environment. And we have economic.
    00:02:27 This can affect commerce, which is the buying and selling of goods. It can affect business, infrastructure-- infrastructure includes things like the electric grids, sewer system, roads, and so on-- and development. Development is the planning and building of new neighborhoods and business areas.
    00:02:51 One example of an environmental issue that has many negative impacts is the deforestation of the Amazon rain forest. The land in the lower right has been deforested. The trees have been removed so that the land can be used for agriculture. Now, the social impacts is that the lack of tree roots can lead to landslides that can ruin fields and homes.
    00:03:19 The political impact is that parts of the rain forest are in 9 countries, all with their own goals for governing. The geographic impacts is that fewer trees in the enormous rain forest increases global warming. The economic impact is that poor areas initially make money by deforestation. But once the trees are gone, the source of income has gone away. Since the habitat has been severely changed or even
    00:03:50 destroyed, the humans or animals that lived in the old habitat may not be able to survive in the new habitat. Let's review the impacts of an environmental issue.
