title: Immigration: Refugees and Asylees
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

! Section 1

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi, my name is Kirsten and I'll be your instructor today. Well hopefully, you and your family have never experienced anything like what this family is going through. Hopefully, you've never had your home destroyed by flood or natural disaster or had to flee your home due to conflict or war. so.
    00:00:20 What happens to people that do experience these types of situations? What happens when their home is destroyed and they can no longer return? Who takes care of them? Who helps them out when they are so totally dependent upon others for kindness and generosity? Well, one organization that tries to help
    00:00:37 with the United Nations. They try to assist the 10 million people around the world who are refugees, people who had to flee their home country and look for a new country in which to call home. In this lesson, we are going to learn about refugees and what countries around the world are doing in order to try to help. This lesson is titled Immigration:
    00:00:57 Refugees and Asylees. Our objectives: to analyze trends in the international migration of refugees, to explore examples of migration due to political, economic, social, or environmental reasons, and to identify challenges facing refugees, their destination countries, and humanitarian aid organizations. In this section, we'll be looking at the first objective
    00:01:19 and as we go along some of your words and terms will be highlighted in purple. They're part of the vocabulary for this lesson. So first, let's take a look at a refugee. What exactly is a refugee? Well, a refugee is a person in a certain situation, and there is a legal definition of a refugee. Because unlike people who just want to come to the United
    00:01:41 States for work or employment, refugees are given special consideration. A refugee is a person unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. This particular definition is from the Immigration and
    00:02:08 Nationality Act of 1952, and in 1967, the United Nations amended this particular definition to include people that were fleeing war or other types of violence. A refugee has to be located outside the United States in order to apply for refugee status. So if someone is forced to leave their home country to another country but they want to come to the US, they apply for status as a refugee before coming to the United States.
    00:02:38 If they come to the United States first, they are not considered a refugee any longer, they're considered an asylum seeker or asylee. An asylum seeker is a person seeking protected entrance to the United States. At the time of application, the person is located inside the United States or a port of entry. Again, a refugee is a person seeking protected entrance to
    00:03:01 the United States and at the time of application, the person is located outside the United States. So that's the main difference. Many times, these people are coming from very similar situations but really, the legal definition that applies depends upon where they're located when they apply for entrance to the United States. Did they just hop on a plane and come to the United States
    00:03:23 on a tourist visa and say, oh, I need to stay because I can't go back to my home country because I'm being persecuted? Or did they leave their country, go to a new country, and now they're trying to come to the United States in order to live and so they're applying as a refugee. So there are two different statuses. So let's take a look at asylum seekers or asylees in the United States.
    00:03:47 There were 25,270 asylees admitted to the United States in 2007. So these people were actually admitted to the United States, they came over and they applied for asylum. 12,463 were admitted affirmatively, which means they had actively applied for asylum. 12,807 were admitted defensively. They had not applied for asylum when they came to
    00:04:15 United States, they were just hoping to defend themselves from being forced to go back to their home country. The top countries of nationality for these asylum seekers were China, Colombia, and Haiti. So let's look at the region of origin for asylees admitted to the United States in 2007. Where did most of these people come from? Some came from Oceania, a very small percentage, 1%.
    00:04:45 1% came from unknown regions. 11% came from Europe, 13% from North America, 14% from South America, 20% from Africa, and the biggest chunk from Asia. 41% of those asylees came from Asia. So basically remember, an asylee is someone who applies for a protected entrance status in the United States, but they are already here. They've managed to get themselves to the United
    00:05:17 States and then they have applied for asylum. Refugees, remember, are trying to get into the United States but they're still living elsewhere. So let's take a look at where the refugees are coming from in 2007. There were 48,217 refugees admitted in 2007. 36% came from Africa, 48% came from Asia, 10% from Europe, 6% from North America, and 1% from Oceania.
    00:05:50 So the vast majority of these refugee seekers, they're applying from countries within Asia and Africa. So let's look at the countries where refugees started at. So they're not necessarily living there anymore because again, they've fled these countries and they're living elsewhere and they're hoping to come to the United States, but what is their country of origin? The top 10 countries of origin of refugees to United States,
    00:06:17 13,856 were from Burma. And likely, they are fleeing the current military dictatorship. It's a very harsh dictatorship. 6,969 are fleeing from Somalia. Lately, Somalia has been home to ethnic and religious conflict, so many people are fleeing from there. We also see large numbers from Iran, Burundi, Cuba, Russia,
    00:06:44 Iraq, Liberia, Ukraine, and Vietnam. So let's take a look at the trend with regard to refugees. We're going to look at two different timeframes between 1999 and 2001, and then from 2004 and 2006. So let's look at 1999 and 2001. The first thing that you see is we see a lot of refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbia and Montenegro. This particular region was faced with a lot of war and
    00:07:18 conflict in the 1990s, so we see large numbers of refugees from these countries during this time period. We can see most of the violence was occurring in Bosnia. So we see far more members coming from Bosnia than we do from Serbia. The other big region that we tend to see people coming from, these are former communist countries.
    00:07:40 Well Vietnam is still communist, I guess. But Russia, Ukraine, and Vietnam. So we see former communist countries and the communist country, although Vietnam's communism is not quite as harsh as it was in the past. Now we're going to see something very different here on this next slide. So how do things change between 2004 and 2006?
    00:08:05 We see Bosnia-Herzegovina, they're not on here anymore. Serbia isn't on here anymore. Instead, we have new countries. We have the country Somalia, we see is sending a large number of refugees. Then Laos, followed by Cuba, Russia, Liberia, and Ukraine. So again, we're getting communist or former communist countries.
    00:08:28 We have Russia and Ukraine here. Liberia also is undergoing a great deal of ethnic conflict and civil conflict within its own borders, so that is the reason we're seeing so many people from Liberia. Somalia, as we mentioned earlier, has a great deal of ethnic and religious conflict as well. So in review, refugees and asylees both are seeking protected entrance into the United States.
    00:08:57 These are different from someone in France saying, oh I want to move to America. I'm just going to call them up on the phone and go. These people get a special status. Their admission policies are different in many ways. They don't have to go through the same processes that people who just want to move to the United States do. Because they're fleeing war and conflict, they do get a
    00:09:18 special status. So refugees are located outside of the United States at the time of their request, while asylees are located in the United States at the time of their request. So they've come over and they don't want to go home. So refugees to the United States in recent years have come from countries such as Burma, Somalia, and Iran, while asylees to the United States in recent years have
    00:09:40 come from China, Colombia, and Haiti. Thank you very much and I'll see you next time.

! Section 2

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi, welcome back. This lesson is Immigration: Refugees, and Asylees. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here. And in this section we'll be looking at our second objective, to explore examples of migration due to political, economic, social, or environmental reasons. Well, let's take a quick look back at what we discussed in our last section.
    00:00:20 Remember, we were talking about asylees and refugees. Those are people that are fleeing their home countries for places elsewhere due to economic reasons, civil war, environmental reasons, and so forth. So let's take a look at some of the graphs we looked at earlier. The top 10 countries of origin of refugees to the United States.
    00:00:39 So these are people coming to the United States, and this graph shows where these people are coming from, and it's for 2007. We can see Burma's number 1 down here. But we're going to pay particular attention to Somalia, and that's because Somalia is going to be our case study. We can see that 6,969 people came from Somalia to the
    00:01:01 United States in 2007. So let's take a look at the years between 2004 and 2006. We can see Somalia is still the number 1 country. More than 12,000 people in 2004. About 10,000 people in 2005. And about 10,000 people in 2006. So why Somalia? Why are so many people choosing to leave Somalia?
    00:01:24 Because they're not just going to the United States, they're going to other countries too. What are the reasons behind that migration? Well, let's take a look at Somalia. Well, Somalia has been faced with a very unstable government. In 1960, they gained their independence from British and Italian colonial powers.
    00:01:43 And since that time, several leaders have been deposed by military coups. Coups in 1969, 1991 and 2004. And today, warlords and militias are struggling for power, and the United Nations and the United States have been unable and unsuccessful at trying to restore the peace. Both the UN and the United States sent
    00:02:05 troops in the 1990s. They were not successful in getting those warlords to cease fighting. And as a result, they withdrew their troops. Constant civil war has been occurring in Somalia, and hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed. So let's take a look at the violence in Somalia. This road is known as the Green Line.
    00:02:28 This road separates North and South Mogadishu, which is the capital of Somalia. And it's the dividing line between the warring clans. And you can see the destruction that has occurred in Somalia. You have a burned-out abandoned car, all the buildings have been destroyed, riddled with bullet holes. So you can imagine what life must be like in Mogadishu.
    00:02:48 Between 2006 and 2007, the violence was the worst it had been in more than 15 years. The fighting was primarily between militias loyal to the Union of Islamic Courts and clan warlords. The transitional government and Ethiopian troops engaged the warlords and Islamic extremists. So Somalia, like many parts of the world, has been struggling with Islamist factions.
    00:03:14 These are factions who want to institute Islamic or Sharia law as the system of government within these countries. In the first four months of 2007, more than 320,000 Somalis fled for safety. And by November, that figure was over 1 million. So people in Somalia, the average civilian people, are starting to flee.
    00:03:37 Because again, when there's war going on, they obviously can't provide for themselves. They can't farm. They can't make a living. And of course, their lives are in danger. So they flee into neighboring countries, and that can cause refugee problems in the neighboring countries as well. So let's take a look at other issues that Somalia is facing.
    00:03:57 Since 2007, in 2008 one of the biggest issues has been piracy off the coast of Somalia, including hijackings and attacks on ships as Somali pirates have been trying to loot those ships for funding to continue the civil war. The head of the UN development program was killed by gunfire in Somalia in 2008, and that Islamist insurgency continued to spread. In 2009, the transitional government of Somalia
    00:04:24 continued to battle the insurgents, and aid agencies believe approximately 4 million people in Somalia are in dire need of food aid. That's one of the biggest problems with civil war, is that when there's fighting and war going on, people cannot farm. They can't grow enough food to feed themselves and their families.
    00:04:43 And Somalia, in particular, the UN and other agencies have been willing to send food to Somalia. But often that food is hijacked by clan warlords, used as bribery to get people on their side. So it's not actually getting to the people who need it. So again, malnutrition, starvation, and famine are huge concerns in Somalia in recent years. So let's take a look.
    00:05:08 On top of that, Somalia's also dealt with some environmental disasters. We can see Somalia's location here on the Indian Ocean. Environmental challenges also result in death and destruction. Severe droughts in Somalia in 1975 and 2001 led to widespread starvation. And again, civil wars and warlords have slowed aid
    00:05:33 assistance to getting the food to the people that need it, getting relief to drought-affected areas. Because again, many of these private agencies want to make sure that their aid workers can be kept safe. And when you have a situation like they have in Somalia, they cannot be sure of that. So often, there's not enough aid given in situations like this.
    00:05:53 On top of that, in 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami, which so devastated the country of Indonesia, also affected Somalia. It displaced tens of thousands of people and killed hundreds. So that has also contributed to the refugee crisis. So in review, Somalis relocated to the United States in large numbers between 2004 and 2006. It's due to unstable governments, disasters, and a
    00:06:18 weak economy, which of course, the civil war contributed to all of those factors. Many people fearing for their lives fled to neighboring countries, and then on to the United States. So we're going to take a little break. When we get back, we're going to take a look at the challenges facing host countries when refugees arrive, as well as the challenges facing refugees as
    00:06:37 they try to build a life in their new homes. So hang on, I'll see you in just a minute.

! Section 3

    00:00:02 PROFESSOR: Welcome back. This lesson is Immigration, Refugees and Asylees. Our objectives for this lesson are here. And in this section, we'll be looking at our third objective, to identify challenges facing refugees, their destination countries, and humanitarian aid organizations. So in this section, we're going to look at the
    00:00:19 challenges that refugees face once they arrive in a new country. We're going to look at the challenges the host country faces, as well the challenges that all these humanitarian organizations face in trying to make sure that refugees get the help they need. So let's start with the challenges facing refugees. Well, they include education.
    00:00:37 Often when people are coming to a new country, they may have had their education interrupted, as a result of whatever what's causing them to flee. They often have to learn a new language, in order to succeed in an educational system. They often struggle, finding employment-- again, the language barrier can be significant to overcome--
    00:00:57 as well as finding good job resources for people that often have had a limited amount of training. Another challenge they face is culture. In addition to language, they have a new way of life to understand. In America, think about how difficult it must be for someone who's never experienced democracy or what it means to be an American citizen.
    00:01:16 Those cultural adjustments can be very difficult as well. And also exploitation-- exploitation meaning someone's being taken advantage of. And often, refugees, again because of their limited education, limited skills, as well as language barriers, often do face exploitation. Sometimes they're working in jobs and not being paid fair wages, or harsh working conditions, and so forth.
    00:01:41 So that is another significant challenge that they must overcome. So what are the challenges facing host countries? Well, often they're related to cost. Because of course, it's very expensive to bring refugees in, as well give them the services that they need to succeed in their new country. Processing the paperwork can be very expensive and time consuming.
    00:02:01 Often attorneys and other types of fees also pile up. Health care needs to be provided. They have to make sure that these refugees don't have contagious diseases, and so forth, as well as programs designed to help refugees acclimate into the new host country. So language programs, education programs, job training programs, relocation programs helping them find
    00:02:24 suitable housing. You know, there's a wealth of problems that refugees face upon arrival in a new country. And of course, the host country bears a lot of the responsibility to help pay for those services that the refugees need. Next let's take a look at the challenges facing humanitarian organizations.
    00:02:41 Well, there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of refugees, around the world that have to be taken care of. Many of them are living in camps in squalid conditions. So of course, the cost to provide services can be overwhelming. We have to make sure that they have enough tents and shelter until permanent locations can be found for people to live, food, water, as well as health care services, the resources
    00:03:07 that people in refugee camps need in order to survive. Also, the role that these humanitarian organizations play in the global, political system. They have to lobby on behalf of refugees. They have to work with the United Nations, and so forth. As well as the governments of the countries, not only where the refugees happen to be living, but also the country where they have fled, it can be very, very overwhelming.
    00:03:34 And finally, keeping refugees safe from exploitation, keeping aid workers safe as well, keeping the doctors that they send to refugee camps safe, that can also be very overwhelming, because often there are not enough troops provided by the refugee camp country or the host country to make sure that everyone is kept safe. And we've seen issue after issue in refugee camps where refugees have been killed by warring factions in the area.
    00:04:04 So let's talk about humanitarian aid. So where does it come from? All the people living in refugee camps around the world, where do they get food? Where do they get water? How do they get tents to live in, and so forth? Well, it could come from many different organizations, including governments like the United States, from the United
    00:04:21 Nations programs, and NGOs or nongovernmental organizations or other humanitarian organizations, such as Doctors Without Borders, for example. That's a great example of an NGO. Those doctors come from industrialized countries typically. They go into places where there are a lot of refugees, to provide health care services for a few weeks at a
    00:04:42 time just to give people checkups, to treat more serious illnesses, and so forth. Now billions of dollars are spent each year to aid those in need. It includes displacement due to environmental hazards. A great example, the 2004 tsunami displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Aid organizations provide support, refuge, finding
    00:05:03 people safe places to relocate to, personnel, health care workers, and so forth, food, health care, training, all kinds of things that refugees need. Not only while they're living in the refugee camp, but also when they arrive in their new destination, helping them acclimate to their new society. So what challenges do refugees face? Well, first often it's sheer numbers.
    00:05:28 Somali refugees, for example, going to Kenya and Yemen in large numbers, not only in the 1990s but also in the 2000s. Kenya has more than a quarter of a million Somali refugees in camps. So 250,000 people living in camps. It can be very difficult to provide services for all those people, make sure they all have enough water, make sure they all have enough food, and make sure that they are kept safe.
    00:05:55 The largest concentration of refugees in the world is there in Kenya. And that is a problem that still exists today. Exploitation is another huge issue. Human trafficking, slavery, prostitution, often refugees again because of their limited cultural and language skills are often taken advantage of by unsavory characters when they arrive in a new country.
    00:06:18 So it's very important that they're monitored, their relocation's monitored to make sure that they find fair and equitable jobs with fair and equitable wages and working conditions and so forth. Often they don't understand that there are such things as minimum wage. So they again often work for far less, not realizing that their rights are being violated.
    00:06:39 Refugee camps themselves pose other dangers, including disease outbreaks. Whenever you have hundreds of thousands of people like in Kenya living in camps, disease outbreaks can occur very swiftly and spread very quickly. Poor conditions, again, people are living in tents, which is very unsuitable shelter in times of storms and so forth. These camps are often understaffed and underfunded
    00:07:02 and undersupplied. So, again, making sure everyone has enough clean water, enough food, can be very, very difficult. So in review, humanitarian aid organizations help to relocate or care for refugees. Now refugees face many challenges, when they arrive in their new host location. Cultural challenges, such as language, employment,
    00:07:24 education, as well as the fear of exploitation. Host countries also face challenges. It's very expensive to provide services and programs for all the refugees who are arriving, as well as health care to make sure everyone is healthy before they're sent off on their own. Organizations face challenges, including funding, resources and so forth.
    00:07:46 So in this lesson, we've learned about refugees and asylees. And I'd like you to think for a few moments, what would happen if suddenly you and your family-- it wasn't safe to live where you live. And you had to pack up in a matter of minutes. And you were shuttled across the border into a camp. And then finally, you were relocated
    00:08:04 to a new host country. What kind of challenges do you think you'd face? What do you think would be the scariest part of that whole process? And then I'd like you to think about what you can do as a host person to help a refugee, if there's a refugee in your school or in your community. What kind of steps could you take to make the transition a
    00:08:23 little easier for them? So, thanks so much and I'll see you next time. Bye
