title: Planning for Everyone
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

 00:00:02 WAGNER: Hello, my name is Mr. Wagner, and I'm going to be your instructor for this lesson titled, "Population." Now have you ever tried to plan for a party? There's some important information that you need to know when planning for parties, such as how many people do you expect to come? Then you might ask yourself, well, how much food do I need? Or how many tables and chairs are going to be needed to sit
00:00:24 everybody comfortably? Or what types of games and recreational activities am I going to have to keep everyone entertained. Now these are important questions that you don't want to get wrong, because you don't want to find yourself in a position where you don't have enough food to feed everybody, or you don't have enough tables and chairs for everybody to sit down and eat comfortably.
00:00:44 Now, let's apply this example to a larger scale, say a government. So governments and leaders are constantly planning for the future. They're constantly planning for the future of societies. Now, the first place that they look when planning for the future is population. How many people are living in a specific area?
00:01:04 So in this lesson, we're going to learn more about population, and how the population is changing in the world around us. So we're going to begin section one of this lesson by looking at our objectives. Our first objective is to define population and compare the populations of major world nations. Then we need to analyze factors that influence
00:01:25 population growth and decline and, finally, understand population density. Now for this section, section one, we're focusing on the first objective again, define population and compare the populations of major world nations. So population is the total number of people that live in a specific area, either a city, or a town, or even a country.
00:01:47 So you can measure population on many different levels. And it's important to note that populations are not evenly distributed. They're not spread out evenly around the world. Some countries have much, much higher populations than other countries, and we'll see that in the next few slides. And there are many factors that can influence where people live.
00:02:08 Many factors that people take into consideration when choosing where to live, so this is why we see the disparate or uneven distribution of populations. So the whole world population has been steadily increasing over time, especially over the past 100 years. So over the past 100 years, the past century or so, we've seen an increase of about five billion people. So that's a lot of people in just 100 year span, a lot of
00:02:41 population growth. As you can see here, around 1950 the rate of increase is increasing dramatically, right here. So we see a much higher increase in that region right there. And by 2011, 2012 it's expected to be around 6.9 to 7 billion people total world population. So it is continuing to grow.
00:03:05 Now here we have a map, a population map. So the populations in countries are denoted by the shade of blue. So the darker than the shade of blue, the higher the population in that country. So we can see here, the highest populations include a east Asia, specifically China, and India, as well as Indonesia, and Brazil, and the United States.
00:03:34 At just over 300 million people, the United States is one of the most populated countries in the world. So as you can see, and there are places, such as Greenland up here and we've got some countries here in west Africa, that are not so populated. So as you can see here, population is not evenly distributed-- back to the point that we made in the last slide.
00:04:00 Now here are five most populated countries, five most populous countries. We have China at between 1.3 and 1.4 billion people. And then India, right behind China, with between 1.2 and 1.3 billion. And then, significantly lower, we have the United States, Indonesia, and Brazil, ranging between from 300 million to just over one 190 million.
00:04:26 So those are our five most populous countries. So let's review this section real quick. We introduced population as a total number of people living in a specific area. And remember, as we can see from this map here, it's important to note that populations are not evenly distributed. However, the world population is estimated around 6.9
00:04:48 billion, expected in the next year or so to be around 7 billion. So it's growing each year. And the five most populous countries we can see here are the United States, Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia. So that is it for section one of our lesson on "Population." I thank you for your attention. I hope that you've learned something new.
