How did the United States change from 1900 to 2000?

* The population more than tripled.
* People moved from rural areas to cities or suburbs.
* The population became older. In 1900, people under 21 made up almost half the country. In 2000, the average person was 35.
* People moved west and south. In 1900, most people lived in the Northeast and Midwest. In 2000, most people lived in the West and South.

This information comes from the US Census. Why take a census? When the United States was founded, part of the representation in government was to be based on population. The people in each region had to be fairly counted. So, the US Constitution requires a census once every ten years.

When a region gains people faster than the rest of the country, it gains more representation. For example, after the 2010 census, Texas gained four seats in the House of Representatives. Ohio lost two seats. This reflected the movement of people out of the Midwest and into the South and West.

When the Constitution was signed in 1787, this type of census was fairly new. The intent was not to determine taxes or service owed to the government. Instead, the Census would help government and citizens see how society was structured. The Census could also identify trends. For example, what jobs did people hold? Was the country becoming older or younger?

Each decade, the Census Bureau sends a 10-question form to every household. The forms ask about things like age, race, and relationships. Census takers visit any homes that donâ€™t return the form. The goal is to obtain an accurate picture of the country.

! Counting People

The Census records how the population has changed. Population rises with births, immigration, and longer life expectancy. It falls with deaths, emigration, and shorter life expectancy.

Each decade the US population has increased. From 2000 to 2010 this change was a little more than 9 percent. Compared to the last several decades, this was a slower rate of growth. Why did this happen? Researchers suggest two causes. Immigration slowed, and the birthrate among Whites decreased.

The rate of change has shifted at other times. When the birth rate increased after World War II, population increased. The population fell once, in 1918, due to deaths in World War I and the flu pandemic.

! Spotting Changes

The Census also collects data on factors such as income, ethnicity, age, education, and work. This information tells us what the country looks like today. We can also see how these demographic factors have changed over time. For example, in 1900, life expectancy was in the 40s. By 1940, it had moved into the 60s. It is now in the upper 70s.

In the 1960s, immigrants made up 5 percent of the county. Forty years later, 12 percent of the country were immigrants. Over time, people have moved away from farming into manufacturing. More recently, people sometimes live in one spot and work remotely in others.

Census data is available to everyone. Governments and other groups use it for planning. Areas with an aging population need more senior services. Areas with a younger population need more schools. Areas with high unemployment need more job training. Areas with high growth may need more roads. The Census provides a reliable source of data about where change is needed.
