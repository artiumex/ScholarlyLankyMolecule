title: Patterns of Fertility and Mortality (OC)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Around the world, major changes are taking place. More and more people are now living in cities. Women now have more opportunities to go to school and to work outside of the home. Improved health care and clean water mean people are living longer and longer. How do all these changes affect our growing world population?

! Today’s World Population

In 2018, the world population reached more than 7.5 billion people. In just the last few decades, people around the world have begun to live longer and have fewer children. People are now living 70.0 years on average, up from 64.6 years only a few decades ago. These are averages, so in some countries and under certain circumstances, people will live a shorter or longer time. What’s causing these changes?
Predictions about 2030, 2050, and 2100

Huge advancements in medicine, clean water, and food handling mean people are living longer. In addition, because of better medical care, fewer women die in childbirth and more children live to become adults. All of these factors mean our population continues to grow. The United Nations predicts that the world population will reach 8.5 billion by 2030, nearly 10 billion by 2050, and 11.2 billion by 2100. Where will all these new people live?

! The World’s Fastest Growing Countries

World population growth will mainly happen in countries and regions where there are still high fertility rates but the mortality rates have begun to drop. These regions tend to be the less developed countries, where more people live in a rural area, and where there are many young people able to have families.

By 2050, Africa’s population may reach up to 2.6 billion people. The population of 26 countries, nearly all in Africa, will at least double. The three African countries with the highest fertility rates and the greatest chance of growth are Niger, Chad, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Asia will also see a big population increase of 717 million people.

! The World’s Most Populated Countries

Other countries, though not growing as fast as some of the African countries mentioned above, will have the most people living in them. One major reason is that they have a large, growing population of young people who can have families.

Currently, China has the highest population of any country. However, its population may decrease. India, with the second highest current population, may pass China by 2050, with a possible population of 1.68 billion people. By 2050, nine countries will make up half of the total people on Earth. These countries are India, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Ethiopia, the United Republic of Tanzania, the United States, Uganda, and Indonesia.

! Countries with Declining Populations

High-income countries are experiencing slow or no population growth, or have declining populations. There are a few reasons for this decline. Many high-income countries have a large number of older people. They also have lower than replacement-level fertility rates, which means that women are having fewer than two children, and so the population is declining. For example, in South Korea the fertility rate in 2017 was 1.2, in Singapore the same year it was 1.1. A total of 38 countries will have smaller populations in 2050 than they do in 2018. Those countries include China, Japan, Russia, and Romania.
