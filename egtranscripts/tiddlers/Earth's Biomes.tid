! Section 1
00:00:02
MR. WAGNER: Hello. My name is Mr. Wagner and I'm going to be your instructor for this lesson titled Earths Biomes. Now I want you to think about your environment, the specific community where you live. Do you live in a big city, or a small town, or maybe even the countryside? Well regardless of the type of town in which you live, or the
00:00:20
type of community, there are specific types of plants and animals with which you live, that are located in your community, that are unique to the ecosystem in which you live. In your ecosystem, where you live is part of a broader biome. It exists within a larger biome. Now if these two terms sound a little
00:00:41
unfamiliar now, that's OK. Ecosystem and biome, we're going to define those terms later in this section. However, it's important to note that we find different biomes and different types of ecosystems throughout the world and in this lesson we're going to learn more about each of those biomes and the reasons for which we have different biomes all over the face of the planet.
00:01:01
So with that we're going to begin section one by looking at our objectives. First we need to understand why the earth's surface is divided into different biomes. And then explore the earth's biomes and identify their locations. And then describe the plant and animal life found in each biome.
00:01:16
Now in section one we're going to focus on the first objective and that's to understand why the earth's surface is divided into different biomes. So what is a biome? {{A biome is a set of areas the supports similar communities of plants, animals, and other species of life.||hl1}} Now a species is just a type of life, a type of living thing.
00:01:35
For instance, cats, dogs, humans, and mice. I just listed four different species of living things, so different types of life. And biomes are grouped together based on climate and vegetation. Now vegetation as a collective body of plant growth that exists within a certain area. Now ecosystems, on the other hand, are smaller communities
00:01:57
that exists within biomes. So smaller communities of living things that exist within each biome, and these are unique to specific locations. So if the distinction between biome and ecosystem seems a little fuzzy right now let's take the next slide to try and clear this up a little bit. So take the desert biome, for example.
00:02:18
We have three different pictures here, three lizards that are all living in the desert biome. They all exist in the desert biome. It's hot, it's dry, there's similar types of animals and plants. However, these three lizards exist in three different ecosystems. They're all part of the same biome, the same type of environment, however they live in different
00:02:38
ecosystems. For instance, the rock agama exists and is native to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, which is in east Asia. The monitor lizard is native to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa. And the collared lizard is native to the Sonoran Desert in the United States. So we have three lizards located in three different
00:03:00
continents throughout the world. They're all part of the same biome. They all live in a desert ecosystem, or desert-like ecosystem, but they live in three different ecosystems. So hopefully that clears up the difference between the larger biome, and then the ecosystems that exists within each biome. Now I'm going to go over the different types of biomes that we find throughout the world.
00:03:23
We're going to talk specifically about these in the next few sections. However, let's just go through them now. We have the tundra, we have a coniferous forest and the deciduous forest biomes, grassland, shrubland, desert, rainforest, and marine biomes as well. Now why are there are so many different biomes? What factors are causing us, or causing these different
00:03:43
biomes to exist? Well, one of them is climate. Different climate zones have different temperatures and amounts of rainfall, so there are plants and animals that are specially suited to exist in certain types of climate zones, dry climates or what climates. Latitude is also very important in determining, or shaping, the biomes found throughout the world.
00:04:07
Different amount of sunlight and warmth, or energy from the earth's sun or-- energy from the sun exists at different latitudes. At lower latitudes, near the equator, there is more energy from the sun and there is less seasonal change. So near the equator, the temperature stays roughly the same all throughout the year. However, when you go to higher latitudes, the mid-level
00:04:31
latitudes, you have warm summers, but very cold winters. And there are different plants and animals that are suited to exist and thrive in those types of latitudes-- in those types of environments. Elevation is also a huge factor in shaping biomes throughout the world. Especially higher elevations where there's less oxygen and
00:04:55
usually a colder climate as well as harsher weather, more extreme weather. And there are certain types of plants and animals, again, that are specially suited to exist in those types of environments. So climate, latitude, and elevation. Let's review this section quickly. We introduced biomes.
00:05:13
There are areas around the world that support similar types of life, similar species of life. And then within those biomes we have ecosystems, and these are smaller communities that exist-- they're unique to specific locations-- but they exist within the larger biomes. {{And factors that affect biomes, or shape biomes are climate, latitude, and elevation.||hl1}}
00:05:34
And that is it for section one of our lesson on Earth's Biomes. I thank you for your attention. I hope that you've learned something new.

! Section 4
00:00:02
WAGNER: Hello, my name is Mr. Wagner. Welcome back to section two of our lesson titled, "Earth's Biomes." Let's begin by looking at our objectives. In this section we need to explore the Earth's biomes and identify their locations, as well as describe the plant and animal life found in each biome. Now, here's our list of the world biomes that we discussed in the last section.
00:00:25
Well, in this section, we're going to focus on the first four, {{the tundra, the coniferous and deciduous forest biomes, as well as the grasslands biome.||hl1}} Let's begin with the tundra, the world's coldest biome. We find the tundra in the polar climate zones, typically the higher latitudes, such as northern Canada, much of Alaska, Siberia, northern Europe. This is where we find very cold temperatures year round.
00:00:53
Again, the tundra exists at the higher latitudes. And this is where there's very little sunlight, which explains why we have such a cold climate, very little sunlight, especially in the winter months. At some points during the winter, there's actually no sunlight. It's actually dark all day long at the peak of the winter months in the tundra.
00:01:16
Now plants have had to adapt to the long periods without sunlight. Like I said, in some points during the winter time, there's virtually no sunlight. So these plants, different mosses and berry plants, have had to adapt to long periods of time without that sunlight. Now, adapt means to modify or become suitable or capable of a certain task.
00:01:41
Well, in this case, this plant life has become capable or has adapted to survive and even thrive without much of that sunlight. Animals have also had to adapt to life in the tundra. For example, polar bears, arctic foxes, and different bird species have had to adapt to the to the severe cold temperatures. For example, the polar bears developed a very thick skin
00:02:07
and a thick fur coat that allows it to survive the cold temperatures and insulates it, keeping it warm Now, let's move to the coniferous forest biome. We find coniferous forests throughout the moderate climate zones, typically in the middle to higher latitudes. And in the coniferous forest biome where you typically have very cold winters and cool Summers.
00:02:34
Now given that type of climate zone, these evergreen trees or conifer trees that make up these coniferous forests, they've learned to adapt, or they have become suitable to surviving the very cold and dry winters. Evergreen trees, unlike deciduous trees, which we'll talk about next, coniferous trees stay green all year round. And instead of leaves, they actually have needles, and
00:03:01
pine cones that spread the seeds for those trees. Again, they have adapted to the very cold temperatures, very important to remember. Animals have also adapted to life in the coniferous forest, such as black bears, grizzly bears, gray wolves, and wolverines, and bald eagles, for example. we. Find these species of animals in the coniferous forest, and
00:03:25
they have adapted, as well, to the cold, dry winters. Now, on to the deciduous forests. We also find deciduous forests in moderate climate zones, located between polar and tropical regions. And we usually find them at more of the middle latitudes, where there are warm summers and cool winters. Trees and plants often lose their leaves in the autumn time.
00:03:54
They've been preparing for the winter, so they lose their leaves for the winter. And that is an adaptation. Their leaves turn brown, and yellow, and all different types of colors. And they shed their leaves, because those leaves release moisture into the air. Well, during the winter months, in order to survive,
00:04:10
they lose those leaves. And they've also developed a thick bark to insulate them from the cold temperatures. So, just like in any other biome, plants, as well as animals, as we'll talk about in a second, have adapted to the types of climate and environment found in the deciduous forest. Animals, again, have adapted to the to the warm summers and cold winters, such as deer, eagle
00:04:37
species, rabbits, and coyotes as well, as well as some species of wolves. And, finally, onto the grasslands biome. We find the grasslands biome-- well, this is where we find dry and continental climates. It's usually very dry, for most part of the year, in the grasslands biome. We typically find these in the continental interior of
00:05:04
continents. For example, the mid-western United States, or some of sub-Saharan Africa is wide grassland, Typically, very little rain. There will be a wet season and a dry season. So they'll receive some rain, but they do have extreme climates. So, in the sense, that they'll receive some rain at one point
00:05:25
in time during the year, but through much of the rest of the year, it's actually very dry. They usually have very warm summers, and can be very cold in the winter as well. And we find these in the middle and low latitudes. Plant life has had to adapt to the extreme weather in the grasslands biome. We typically find many species of grass, different grasses.
00:05:47
The height of the grass can depend on the amount of precipitation that any region or grassland receives. And there can also be small trees in the grasslands biome. And animals have also had to adapt to the extreme weather. Again, warm summers, it's very dry for much of the year in the grasslands. And some of these animals include bison, as well as coyotes, and jackrabbits, as well as many bird species.
00:06:17
So let's review this section. We covered the first four of our world biomes. The tundra, the coldest biome in the world, this is where plants and animals have had to adapt to very cold temperatures, as well as long periods of time without sunlight. As well, we covered our coniferous forest biome. This is where we find evergreen trees that can
00:06:39
survive those cold, dry winters. Deciduous forest biome, which we find the changing leaves, the leaves change color, the trees shed their leaves as an adaptation for surviving those cold winters. And, finally, we got to the grasslands biome. Now this is where, again, we have extreme weather, very dry parts of the year, and it can be very, very warm as well as very cold.
00:07:06
And plants and animals have had to adapt to those extreme temperatures and extreme climatic conditions. That is it for section two of our lesson on the Earth's biomes. I thank you for your attention. I hope you find something new.

! Section 7
00:00:02
PROFESSOR: Hello, my name is Mr. Wagner, and welcome back to section three of our lesson titled Earth's Biomes. Let's begin by looking at our objectives again. We're still on the last two objectives. And that's again to explore the earth's biomes, and identify their locations, as well as describe the plant and animal life found in each biome. So we've talked about the tundra, we discussed the two
00:00:23
forest biomes, coniferous and deciduous forest biomes, as well as the grasslands biome. Well, let's focus now on {{shrubland, desert, rainforest, and marine biomes.||hl1}} So let's begin with the shrubland biome, also called the chaparral or savannah biome. And we find these environments or these ecosystems-- we find the shrubland biome, I should say, in the moderate
00:00:46
climate zones. They typically experience mild winters, and summers can be very warm summers actually, but very mild winters, and wet and dry seasons. So sort of like the grasslands we talked about in the last section, the shrublands can experience a lot of rainfall or a lot of precipitation at certain points in the year, but in other times of year there can be long stretches
00:01:11
without any precipitation. So there's a wet season and a dry season. And we typically find this biome in the middle and low latitudes, and specifically around bodies of water, as well as surrounding desert biomes. So we'll find shrubland along coastal regions, like around the Mediterranean Sea for example, as well as in southern California, and Mexico, and Chile.
00:01:36
And we also find them surrounding desert biomes, because they receive more rainfall than the desert. So there's more shrub growth, and more grasses, that can survive in the shrubland than in the desert because they receive more rain. But it's also very dry, so we typically find the shrublands surrounding the desert biomes. There's a big distinction between shrubland and desert.
00:02:01
However, they both tend to have very dry climates at least for part of the year. And plants and animals again have had to adapt to the long dry seasons and warm temperatures. Again, we have a lot of species of shrubs that typically don't have many big leaves, so they conserve and protect that moisture within the plant. They don't grow very tall, because there's not enough
00:02:27
rainfall to support large trees. So we typically have very short trees, and shrubs, and different species of grasses. As far as animals go we have rattlesnakes, possums, foxes, and smaller animals that can survive in the brush and in the shrubland. Now on to the desert biome. Desert biome is the driest biome in the world.
00:02:55
And it's called the desert because of it's very dry climate and extreme temperatures. So in the summertime it can get extremely hot, but in the winter and especially at night it can get extremely cold. Because the air is so dry, there's a lot of temperature variation. It can get very cold, and very hot, relatively quickly. Also very little rainfall.
00:03:19
The interesting thing about deserts is that they are found at all different latitudes. So Mongolia for example, which is a relatively high latitude, there is a desert there, the Gobi Desert. And there are deserts such as in South Africa, which are also relatively high latitudes. But then we have deserts in the middle latitudes, like the Sonoran Desert in the United States.
00:03:42
Found at all latitudes, and plants have been able to adapt to life in this dry climate that have been able to withstand drought. Drought is basically a prolonged period of time without any rainfall, without any precipitation. So take cacti for example, the Saguaro cacti that you can see here in this picture. They actually store water and use it very slowly, they store
00:04:05
water in their stems and use that water very slowly. They conserve that water. And animals have also adapted to life in this very dry biome, in the very dry climate that is the desert-- animals such javelina, as you see here, as well as scorpion and many snake and lizard species that have been able to adapt and survive in the deserts. Now we've come to our rainforest biome.
00:04:33
Rainforests are located in the tropical climate zones, which are typically near the equator at the lower latitudes. And this is where we find very warm temperatures, and large amounts of rainfall. Actually very large amounts of rainfall. And this is where we find a lot of biodiversity. So there's a lot of biodiversity, which means that there's a lot of different species, for instance, plants,
00:04:56
animals, insects, and even bacteria and different microbes. Scientists attribute this to the consistency in not only precipitation, so there's always an abundance of water, but also consistency in temperature. The temperature doesn't really change much in the equatorial regions, in these equatorial tropical regions near the equator.
00:05:20
Temperature stays pretty consistent throughout the year, as well as the levels of rainfall. So there's a large amount of biodiversity. Many plants that require large amounts of water, they can exist there, as well as many animals that can survive in the deep jungles and forests, and in those warm humid climates. So now we're moving on to the marine biome.
00:05:43
This is our final biome. And this covers about 71% of the earth's surface, it's actually covered in water. Now this includes salt water and fresh water. Such as lakes, rivers, our oceans, our saltwater oceans, as well as the coral reefs that are in the oceans. And many different plants and animal species exist in the marine biomes depending on the depths, at
00:06:11
the very ocean deeps. At the very depths of the ocean, for example, it's very cold. So you'll find much different plant and animal life existing there, than you would for instance in the shallower waters or the tropical waters near a land mass for example. So the plant and animal life depends on where you are in the ocean, the temperature of the water, as well as the
00:06:32
depth of the water that you're looking at. So let's review this section. We covered the last four of our world's biomes. We began with the shrubland, which can also be called the chaparral or the savannah. Again very small trees, and shrub growth, it's typically a dry climate. And dry but moderate climate, that is typically found in
00:06:55
coastal regions like southern California or the Mediterranean. Also covered the desert, which is the world's driest biome. And plants and animals have adapted to long periods of time without water, which is also called a drought. And then we went to the rainforest, where there's an abundance of water. And these are large amounts of water, as well as warm
00:07:17
temperatures, and these are found in the tropical regions or the equatorial regions, or the low level latitudes near the equator. Large amounts of biodiversity as well, in the rainforest biome. And then finally we got to the marine biome, this includes not only our saltwater body of ocean, our saltwater body, but also includes lakes, rivers, as well as streams and other
00:07:43
types of bodies of water. So that is it for our lesson on earth's biomes. I thank you for your attention, I hope that you've learned something new.
