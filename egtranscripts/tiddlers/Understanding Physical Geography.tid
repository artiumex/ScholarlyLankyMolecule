TEACHER: Hi, my name is Kirsten, and I'm your instructor today. Well, perhaps in the past you've heard of us refer to our planet as the Living Earth. That's because it's always changing. New mountains are being created a little bit every year while other mountains are wearing away. Lava and volcanoes are reshaping the surface of the Earth.
00:00:21
The plates on the Earth's surface are constantly moving creating earthquakes and rifts. And in this lesson, we're going to look at how the Earth is always changing and the process that affect that change. This lesson is Understanding Physical Geography. Our objectives: to explore the physical systems that shape the Earth's surface, to identify land forms and bodies
00:00:42
of water commonly found on the Earth's surface, and to compare the various climates and biomes found on Earth. In our first section, we'll be looking at our first objective. And as we go along, some of our words and terms will be highlighted in purple. Pay close attention because these are your vocabulary terms for this lesson.
00:00:57
So let's get started. In this section, we're going to look at the changing surface of the Earth. And first, let's take a look at the various layers of the Earth. On this model, you can see that the Earth is made up of layers. First we have the crust. This is the solid outer layer.
00:01:12
And thin layers of rock called plates cover the Earth's surface. Now the Earth's crust is anywhere between three and 30 miles thick depending upon where on the surface you happen to be. Next, we have the mantle. It's a liquid layer made up of silicon, magnesium, oxygen, and other elements.
00:01:32
It's constantly cooling, sinking, heating, and rising. Because as it heats up it expands, as it cools it shrinks. This is the process that's really changing volcanic activity and things like that. This layer is approximately 1800 miles thick. Next, we have the outer core. It's a liquid layer, melted iron and nickel primarily.
00:01:54
It's approximately 1400 miles thick. And then finally the inner core. It's solid and very very hot, mostly iron and nickel, approximately 860 miles thick. So let's take a look at the Earth's crust. And again, the Earth's crust is made up of giant sheets of rock called plates. And we can see the major plates on this particular map.
00:02:15
Take a look here. The North American plate, for example, is here. You can see the United States is located here. And we're going to talk about what happens when these plates move against each other or are forced into each other or spread apart from each other. The theory of plate movement is called plate tectonics. Now this explains the shaping of the Earth's surface.
00:02:36
The plates sit on that liquid layer of mantle, and they move very very slowly and very gradually. Sometimes just millimeters or inches a year, sometimes more. And they cover the entire surface of the Earth including water and land. Now there are many major plates including the African plate, the Antarctic plate, Indo-Austrailian, Eurasian, North American, South American, and Pacific plate.
00:03:04
But there are dozens and dozens of smaller plates, as well. So let's take a look at the theory of continental drift. Now this theory was developed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. And the idea behind this theory is that once there was a super continent called Pangaea. This super continent existed over 250 million years ago. And the idea here is that by looking at the coastlines of
00:03:29
the continents of the world they appear to fit together like a puzzle. And so the theory goes that, at one time, they were all connected, and then over time they have shifted into the places that they are today. And you can see that on the little video, the giant continent breaking apart. Now the continents today continue to move across the
00:03:51
Earth's surface, those plates continue to move, and that's why we see volcanic activity, and earthquakes, and mountains being formed, and so forth. It's due to the movement of those plates. So let's look at how this process occurs. Now convergent plate movement occurs when two plates hit one another, and the results can differ. Sometimes when we have two oceanic plates one may be pushed
00:04:14
underneath the other. This can result in rising magma from the mantle, and it can create underwater volcanoes. Next, we have continental and continental plates. And when these two plates meet, they tend to be pushed upward, and as a result, mountains are formed. Sometimes an oceanic plate and a continental plate meet and the oceanic plate is denser, so it will slide under the
00:04:39
continental plate. And as a result, this process called subduction creates a trench, and earthquakes are very common among these subduction zones around the world. So let's take a look here at this graphic, and you can see what's going on here. We see the oceanic plate colliding with a continental plate.
00:05:02
And that dense oceanic plate is going underneath the continental plate creating that trench that we talked about, as well as, whenever continental plates are in areas where they move a lot on the edges we also tend to see earthquakes and volcanoes and things like that, as well. So let's take a look at what happens when plates separate. Sometimes plates are not going towards each other, sometimes they're moving away from each other.
00:05:30
And when plates separate, we call this divergent plate movement. And you can see it in the graphic here, this can result in seafloor spreading. Which means magma rises up from the mantle and it creates new land or a new crust, hot lava rises up to fill that gap, and sometimes we see a mid-ocean ridge or an underwater mountain range like we see in this graphic.
00:05:54
Now this can happen on land, as well. A great example of divergent plate movement is the Great African Rift. It creates trenches and valleys across the eastern part of Africa. Divergent plate movement is also responsible for the Red Sea which lies between Saudi Arabia and Africa. Next, let's take a look at what happens when plates slide
00:06:17
against each other. Sometimes they're not going towards each other, and they're not going apart. Instead, they are just kind of rubbing against each other. They can transform the plate boundary. And what often happens is as they slide they get stuck and then suddenly they just jerk. And whenever that jerking motion occurs, we see
00:06:33
earthquakes like we see here on this graphic. Friction and pressure are created and, of course, that friction and pressure has to be released somewhere, and so it happens in the form of earthquakes. So we see earthquakes, for example, along the Pacific coast of the United States because we have that kind of plate activity that's occurring in that area. So in review, we talked about plate tectonics.
00:06:58
And this is the theory of the shaping of the Earth's surface. The different continental plates sit on the liquid mantle, and they move very gradually sometimes just inches or even millimeters per year. The plate movement can result in the formation of mountains, volcanoes, and also earthquakes. So we're going to take a little break.
00:07:19
And when we get back we're going to look at some of the land forms that can be found on the Earth's surface. So hang on, I'll see you in just a minute.

! Section 2
00:00:01
TEACHER: Hi, my name is Kirstin and I'll be your instructor today. Today's lesson is Understanding Physical Geography. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section we'll be looking at the second objective, to identifying landforms and bodies of water commonly found on the Earth's surface.
00:00:18
Well, there are many terms that geographers use in order to identify certain types of landforms or bodies of water. We're going to take a look at some of those terms now. The first is a plain, flat, open grasslands. And those are commonly found in the central US. A plateau, an area of flat land that is higher than the surrounding land. And a canyon, deep valley with steep sides.
00:00:43
And of course, the Grand Canyon in Arizona is one of the most famous canyons in the world. Next, we have an island, a body of land completely surrounded by water. A peninsula, land that is surrounded by water on three sides. And of course, Florida has a very large peninsula. And an isthmus, a narrow strip of land that connects the two
00:01:04
larger land masses. So North and South America are connected by the isthmus of Panama. Next, we have a mountain, a land mass higher than a hill that projects well above its surroundings. A hill is a raised land mass or a mound. And a volcano, a vent in the Earth's crust through which lava, ashes, and gases are expelled.
00:01:29
And of course, on the big island of Hawaii, we have an active volcano that's been active for many, many years. Another common landform is an alluvial fan, deposits of soil and rock at the mouth of a river. A coastline, the boundary between oceans and landforms. And a desert, arid land with a very small amount of yearly precipitation. Next, we have a delta, the watery land located at the
00:01:57
mouth of a river. They are very important to marine ecosystems, such as the Nile River Delta and the Mississippi River Delta. A strait, a narrow body of water connecting two larger bodies of water. You can see a really excellent representation on this satellite photo. A river, a large flowing natural body of water.
00:02:18
And a lake, a large body of water surrounded by land on all sides. A gulf is ocean that is partially enclosed by land larger than a bay. And the Gulf of Mexico is an important gulf to the United States. An estuary, a place where a river meets an ocean. And a bay, smaller than a gulf, but a body of water
00:02:42
partially enclosed by land. And many American settlements were started near bays, such as the Massachusett's Bay Colony and the city of San Francisco. Now there are two important physical processes we're going to take a look at that shaped the Earth's surface. They create coastline and bays and mountains and changed their form.
00:03:03
And these two processes are called weathering and erosion. And we're going to take a look at weathering first. Weathering is the breaking down of rocks into sediment or soil, and it has three major processes: physical, chemical, or biological. We're going to take a look at each of those processes now. First is physical weathering, which is extreme heat or cold causing the decay of surfaces.
00:03:27
So an example would be rocks in the desert. The desert can get very hot in the summer, upwards of 120 degrees. And these high temperatures can cause the outer surface of the rock to weaken, and then it finally blows away in the wind. The same thing can happen with extremely cold temperatures. They can also weaken rock.
00:03:46
And sometimes water will even seep into a rock. And of course, when water freezes it expands, and this can cause rock to crack. The next process is chemical. Substances and solutions can cause chemical changes. And this can be caused by rain, which can sometimes be acidic, causing the rock to wear away. Or sometimes water and oxygen, or water and carbon dioxide
00:04:09
can interact chemically with the type of rock, such as limestone. This can also cause chemical changes which make the rock weaker and, therefore, more susceptible to wind and water. The next type of weathering is biological weathering. Organisms also can aid in the breakdown of rock. Such organisms like moss can grow on rock and cause chemical changes, as well as plants.
00:04:36
Seeds can fall into the cracks of rock and they can then germinate, and the seeds will crack the rock open as well. Now the next physical process is erosion. And erosion wears away rock and soil, moving the sediments to another location. And the common types of erosion that we see here on Earth are wind, water, and waves, all of which cause erosion and cause the rock to fall away.
00:05:03
Wind erosion is the slow, deliberate change caused by the wind. It can wear down surfaces and transport sediment. Many of the sides of canyons or the sides of rocks are caused by wind erosion. Water erosion is also extremely common. This can happen very, very rapidly. Visible changes can carve rocks, transport sediment, and
00:05:27
alter the landscape. Imagine when flooding occurs. When the flood waters die away, of course, the roads and the land are covered by mud and debris caused by water. Or sometimes, when communities get a great deal of rainfall on the side of mountains, we can also see houses caused to fall away because of erosion of the land. Next, we have wave erosion.
00:05:54
This happens more slowly. Waves can wear down beaches and move sands along a shoreline. So in this section, we looked at the common landforms found on the Earth's surface. This included things like mountains, canyons, plateaus, plains. And then we also looked at common bodies of water found
00:06:16
on the Earth's surface. These bodies of water can connect landforms, such as gulfs, bays, rivers, and lakes, as well as deltas and straits. Finally, we looked at the physical processes of weathering and erosion, which altered the Earth's landforms over short periods of time and long periods of time. Thank you and have a great day.

! Section 3
00:00:02
TEACHER: Hi, my name is Kirsten. And I'll be your instructor today. Today's lesson is Understanding Physical Geography. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section we'll be looking at the third objective, to compare the various climate zones and biomes found on Earth.
00:00:18
Well, there are many different types of climates that can be found, dozens and dozens and dozens. But it's difficult to look at climate in that kind of detail. So what we're going to do instead is put the climate in a few broad categories. We're going to look at climates in the higher latitudes, those latitudes closest to the poles; the
00:00:39
middle latitudes, latitudes that fall roughly between the tropics and the Arctic and Antarctic Circle; and the lower latitudes, those latitude that fall between the tropics circle and the equator. There are also two other type of climates we're going to take a look at, those in dry climates and highland climates. So first, let's take a look at the typical climates of the
00:01:01
high latitudes. So again, we're looking at the climates closest to poles. The first is subarctic. Subarctic climates have cold winters and short, cool to mild summers. They have low precipitation, which means they don't get a lot of rain or snowfall. And they typically are found on eastern coasts and
00:01:21
interiors of higher latitudes. Next we have tundra climates, which have long, cold winters and a short, mild season in the summer, less than 15 inches of precipitation, and you typically find these in higher latitudes on coastal regions. Next we have the ice cap, extremely cold year-round and frozen year-round, less than 10 inches of precipitation.
00:01:50
And we typically find these in the polar regions such as on Antarctica. Next we're going to take a look at the climates found in the middle latitudes, so, again, from about the tropics to about the Arctic and Antarctic Circle. The first is humid continental. There are four distinct seasons. They have hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters.
00:02:13
And we typically find these along eastern coasts and interiors within the middle latitudes. Next we have a humid subtropical, hot, humid summers and cool, wet winters. And we typically find these on eastern coasts within the middle latitudes. Other middle latitude climates include a Mediterranean climate.
00:02:37
Mild winters and long, sunny, dry summers. Western coast with middle latitudes. So you find these obviously around the Mediterranean, as well as southern California. Next is a marine, west coast climate, cool, wet winters with mild summers. And we find these along western coasts within upper to middle latitudes.
00:03:00
So, Washington State, for example, has a marine west coast climate. Next we have climate zones found in the low latitudes. So we're looking at the region starting in the tropics and down to the equator. First is a humid tropical, warm and rainy year-round and 80 inches or more of annual precipitation.
00:03:23
And we find these along the equator. Next is a tropical savanna. It's warm all year but has dry and rainy seasons, about 20 inches of annual precipitation. And we find these in the tropics, such as along the coast of Africa, the eastern coast of Africa. Next we have some dry climates we're going to take a look at. The first is a desert climate, mild winters and long sunny
00:03:51
dry summers, less than 10 inches of annual rainfall. And we find these on continental interiors, typically around 30 degrees latitude. Next is the steppe climate, hot summers with cool winters. And they get a little more rainfall, between 10 and 20 inches of annual precipitation. And we find these in continental interiors,
00:04:17
especially along desert borders. Finally we have the Highland climate. The Highland climate is characterized by variable temperatures, depending on elevation. So we find these obviously in mountain ranges. And the higher up the mountain you go, obviously the temperature's going to decrease. Precipitation changes based on elevation.
00:04:40
Again, higher elevations get more snowfall than lower elevations. And we find these in high mountain regions, such as the Rocky Mountains or in the Alps or Himalayas. So in review, we looked at the different types of climate patterns found here on Earth. There are climates in the high latitudes, middle latitudes, and lower latitudes that share certain characteristics.
00:05:04
We also see climates that are dry. And we see climates that are Highland climates, based on elevation. Thank you. Now let's take a look at what we've learned in this lesson. First, we learned all about the different types of landforms found here on Earth, as well the different types of climates that we find.
00:05:26
And let's think about how climate and landform change the way in which we live. What types of benefits do you get from the different types of landforms? Is there a benefit to being near an ocean or a benefit to being on a grassy plain? What kind of changes do you make in your life depending on your climate?
00:05:43
Do the people in Arizona live differently than people who live in Minnesota? Let's think about where you live. How did the landforms near you or the climate near you change your life? And what can we learn about how humans adapt based on the climate or landforms in which we live in proximity to? Have a great day.
00:06:04
And I'll see you next time.
