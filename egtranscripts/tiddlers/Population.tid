! Section 1
00:00:02 WAGNER: Hello, my name is Mr. Wagner, and I'm going to be your instructor for this lesson titled, "Population." Now have you ever tried to plan for a party? There's some important information that you need to know when planning for parties, such as how many people do you expect to come? Then you might ask yourself, well, how much food do I need? Or how many tables and chairs are going to be needed to sit 00:00:24 everybody comfortably? Or what types of games and recreational activities am I going to have to keep everyone entertained. Now these are important questions that you don't want to get wrong, because you don't want to find yourself in a position where you don't have enough food to feed everybody, or you don't have enough tables and chairs for everybody to sit down and eat comfortably. 00:00:44 Now, let's apply this example to a larger scale, say a government. So governments and leaders are constantly planning for the future. They're constantly planning for the future of societies. Now, the first place that they look when planning for the future is population. How many people are living in a specific area? 00:01:04 So in this lesson, we're going to learn more about population, and how the population is changing in the world around us. So we're going to begin section one of this lesson by looking at our objectives. Our first objective is to define population and compare the populations of major world nations. Then we need to analyze factors that influence 00:01:25 population growth and decline and, finally, understand population density. Now for this section, section one, we're focusing on the first objective again, define population and compare the populations of major world nations. So population is the total number of people that live in a specific area, either a city, or a town, or even a country. 00:01:47 So you can measure population on many different levels. And it's important to note that populations are not evenly distributed. They're not spread out evenly around the world. Some countries have much, much higher populations than other countries, and we'll see that in the next few slides. And there are many factors that can influence where people live. 00:02:08 Many factors that people take into consideration when choosing where to live, so this is why we see the disparate or uneven distribution of populations. So the whole world population has been steadily increasing over time, especially over the past 100 years. So over the past 100 years, the past century or so, we've seen an increase of about five billion people. So that's a lot of people in just 100 year span, a lot of 00:02:41 population growth. As you can see here, around 1950 the rate of increase is increasing dramatically, right here. So we see a much higher increase in that region right there. And by 2011, 2012 it's expected to be around 6.9 to 7 billion people total world population. So it is continuing to grow. 00:03:05 Now here we have a map, a population map. So the populations in countries are denoted by the shade of blue. So the darker than the shade of blue, the higher the population in that country. So we can see here, the highest populations include a east Asia, specifically China, and India, as well as Indonesia, and Brazil, and the United States. 00:03:34 At just over 300 million people, the United States is one of the most populated countries in the world. So as you can see, and there are places, such as Greenland up here and we've got some countries here in west Africa, that are not so populated. So as you can see here, population is not evenly distributedâ€“ back to the point that we made in the last slide. 00:04:00 Now here are five most populated countries, five most populous countries. We have China at between 1.3 and 1.4 billion people. And then India, right behind China, with between 1.2 and 1.3 billion. And then, significantly lower, we have the United States, Indonesia, and Brazil, ranging between from 300 million to just over one 190 million. 00:04:26 So those are our five most populous countries. So let's review this section real quick. We introduced population as a total number of people living in a specific area. And remember, as we can see from this map here, it's important to note that populations are not evenly distributed. However, the world population is estimated around 6.9 00:04:48 billion, expected in the next year or so to be around 7 billion. So it's growing each year. And the five most populous countries we can see here are the United States, Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia. So that is it for section one of our lesson on "Population." I thank you for your attention. I hope that you've learned something new. 

! Section 2
00:00:03 PROFESSOR: Hello, my name is Mr. Wagner, and welcome back to section two of our lesson titled Population. Let's take a look at our objective for this section, which is the second objective of the lesson. And that is to analyze factors that influence population growth and decline. So now that we've defined population, and looked at the distribution of population on a global scale. 00:00:23 Let's figure out, A, how do we measure population growth and decline. And B, what factors effect population growth and decline. So let's begin with measuring percent change of population. We begin with the birth rate. Now the birth rate measures the number of births per year, for every 1,000 people. And likewise we have the death rate, how many deaths are 00:00:49 there per year for every 1,000 people. And then we have the migration rate. The migration rate measures the net migration. So you take how many people have migrated to a country, and then you subtract the number of people who have exited that country, or migrated away from or out of the country. That gives you your net migration rate, and that could 00:01:10 either be a positive or negative. Now population growth rate is the average annual percent change in the population. So this takes into account birth rate, death rate, and migration rate. So this is the average annual percent change in population. Now this can be positive or negative. As you can see here, it's not the same around the world. 00:01:32 Many countries in Africa, here we have an example of Zimbabwe, have high population growth rates. And this is one of the highest in the world, over 4% population growth rate. Some countries, especially in Europe, have negative growth rates. Their population is actually shrinking. And the United States is holding steady at just under 00:01:53 1% growth rate of the population, which is just under the world average of 1.09% growth rate. So not only are distributions, as we saw in the last section, the distribution of populations are uneven. So is the population growth rates are also uneven or different depending on where you are in the world. Now geographers use many different tools to look at population data. 00:02:22 We're going to look at one of those, and that's the population pyramid. Now the population pyramid is used to visually represent population data, and it represents gender and age. So here we have the population pyramids for two countries, Austria in 2005 and Belize in 2005. Now as you can see in Austria, the greatest percentage or the age group with the highest percentage of the population, 00:02:48 looks to be middle adults. So middle-aged adults seem to make up the highest percentage of the age distribution in Austria. While in Belize, we have more of a pyramid looking population pyramid. And that's because the greatest percentage of the population belongs to the younger age groups. Now this typically, when you have a pyramid looking 00:03:12 population pyramid, when it actually looks like a pyramid, that tends to mean that the population is expanding. Or it should be expanding in the near future. While this distribution for Austria, this usually means that the population is not really growing or expanding. Or if it's growing, it's growing at a very slow rate. So that is the population pyramid. Now let's consider some factors that 00:03:38 effect population growth. One is health, the access to doctors and. Medicine In a country where population has better access to doctors, and hospitals, and medicine, there's probably going to be a lower death rate than what you would see in say sub Saharan Africa. And also you're going to have a lower infant mortality rate, which is the number of deaths for children under the age of 00:04:02 five per year for every 1,000 people. So you have fewer babies dying at birth, because they have access to medicine, and then fewer people overall dying because they have better access to medicine or lower death rate. That means the chances are the population is going to hold stable, or even perhaps see some population growth there. Culture also effects population growth. 00:04:29 Some cultures value large families, that encourage people to have large families. Which would encourage or would seem to encourage population growth. Other cultures in other countries do not have that cultural emphasis on large families, and thus that would not be a reason for having population growth. Economics, also a major reason. 00:04:54 In countries where there's a lot of jobs and economic opportunities, you're going to see a lot of migration to that country. Take United States for example, after World War II, we were the world's only super economic superpower. And so we saw a lot of migration. People from around the world coming here to take advantage of the employment, and the economic opportunities. 00:05:14 And access to education is also a big reason for migration. We have some of the world's best universities and colleges here in the United States, and people from all around the world migrate here to take advantage of that education. So let's review this section quickly. We began by talking about how population growth rate is measured. 00:05:34 Remember we take into account birth rate, death rate, and migration rate. And geographers, we looked at a tool the geographers use to look at population data. And that's the population pyramid. It shows the distribution of the population in male and female, as well as it takes into account the age distribution. 00:05:55 It's a nice visual way of looking at the population data. And we also consider factors that effect population. We considered health or medicine, the access to health care and medicine, as well as cultural factors. Such as factors that encourage large families, and might encourage higher population growth. As well as economics, also effect 00:06:22 population growth rates. So that is it for section two of our lesson on Population. I thank you for your attention, I hope that you've learned something new.

! Section 3
00:00:02 PROFESSOR: Hello, my name is Mr. Wagner. Welcome back to section three of our lesson titled Population. Let's begin by looking at our objective for the section which is to understand population density. Now so far, we've defined population, we've talked about reasons for which populations grown and decline. We've also studied population growth rates. 00:00:24 Well, now we're going to focus on population density, which is the measure of the size of the population relative to an area's land size. So we're essentially looking at how crowded a specific area is. If you look here, look at this picture on your left. You can see this appears to be an area with relatively low population density. 00:00:46 This is when we have few people living together in a specific area. Now here is your picture on the right, this looks terrifyingly crowded. This is an area with high population density, where we have many people living together in a specific area. Now geographers use maps to indicate population density, or to show population density. 00:01:10 And the areas are shaded based on their levels of population density. So here on our map, we have our lighter shades of yellow which indicate areas of low population density. We also have our darker shades of red, which indicate areas of high population density. So this is how geographers illustrate population density around the world. 00:01:34 And as you can see, populations are not evenly distributed. We can see, we're going to zoom in here, on Europe and Asia. We can see these are actually some of the most highly populated areas in the world. In Europe we have just over 700 million people living in this region, and you can see the dark red spots of areas of 00:01:53 high population density. East Asia, extremely populated region, this includes China, Mongolia, the Koreas, as well as Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Some of the most highly populated areas in the world. And this totals to a population of just under 1.6 billion people. And the most populated area or region in the world, is the 00:02:16 Indian subcontinent. South Asia, if you will. And this includes India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, as well as Pakistan. And you can see here, these relatively large dark areas of red. These are areas with very high population density. And again this region totals about 1.6 billion people. 00:02:40 We're going to zoom in here on Japan. And as you can see here, we have these dark shades of red. These areas of dark red. Now these are our highest areas, with the highest population density. And these are our cities and towns in Japan, or our urban areas. Urban areas are our most populated areas, or areas with 00:03:02 the highest population density. And again, these are cities and towns. And in Japan this is specifically Tokyo, and Osaka. Now many geographers believe Tokyo to be the largest city in the world, so this is one of the most highly populated cities with the highest population density. Now here we have a picture of a rural area. So this is the opposite of an urban area. 00:03:27 So urban areas again, are cities and towns. While rural areas are the countryside. And this is an area with relatively low population density. But what has been happening over time, is the world is becoming more urban. People are moving from the countryside and settling in the cities throughout the world. 00:03:46 And we call this a process of urbanization. So they're moving from the rural areas, the countryside, and they're moving to the urban areas. We're going to call this urbanization. Now this is a process that has been happening for awhile. And as early as 1950, as we can see here in this graph, we have nearly 3/4 of the world's population living in the countryside, living in rural areas. 00:04:10 And as early as 2008, right around this time period, for the first time in the world's history, there were more people living in urban areas, in our cities and towns, than living in the countryside. And this trend seems to be continuing. It's projected, it looks like with this graph, by 2050 to have nearly 3/4 of the world's population living in urban areas instead of in the countrysides. 00:04:37 So interesting development that has been occurring for the last 50 years or so. So let's review this section. We introduced population density that measures the number of people living together in a given area relative to the area's land size, so essentially, how crowded an area is. And some of the most densely populated areas, again, are 00:05:02 South and East Asia. And we can see, as we saw with our graph, or our map of the world with population density, the populations are not evenly distributed around the world. We have much more of the world's population located in East and South Asia than anywhere else. Urban populations, we introduced urban and rural populations, urban being the towns and cities, rural being 00:05:26 the countryside. And we have a process that we just talked about of urbanization, where people are moving from the countrysides and settling in urban areas. And this process of urbanization seems to be, it's projected I should say, to continue into the future. So what happens? So we know that this process of urbanization is probably 00:05:50 going to continue. So what happens when the populations in cities continue to grow? When people continue to leave the countryside and move into these cities? Well let's take it back to our example from the introduction of section one. When you're planning a party. 00:06:06 When you plan a party, you need to plan ahead. You need to figure out how many people are coming, plan for the amount of food that you're going to need, plan for the number of chairs and tables you're going to need. Well this is called planning, and you're planning based on the number of people you expect to be at your party. Well the same goes for governments and cities around the world. 00:06:26 Government leaders, and leaders in the cities, need to plan ahead for future populations. They need to study population growth and decline, so that they are prepared to support those rising populations. So again, preparing. It's all in the preparedness. How prepared are you for these rising populations? It's central at being prepared for these rising populations, 00:06:52 is actually studying population. And the reasons for which populations grow and decline. So that is it for our lesson on population. I thank you for your attention, I hope you've learned something new.
