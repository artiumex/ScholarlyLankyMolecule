! Section 1

    00:00:01 KIRSTEN: Hi, my name is Kirsten, and I'm your instructor today. Do you have dreams of a big move in your future? Maybe you want to attend a college or university in a different state, or you've always wanted to live in a big city so you're interested in moving to Chicago or New York, or maybe you're interested in living near the ocean so you can surf every day so you find
    00:00:21 California or Hawaii appealing. Throughout human history, people have moved for many different reasons, sometimes temporarily, and often permanently, sometimes thousands of miles away. In this lesson, we're going to learn all about why people move. This lesson is titled Movement Migration. Our objectives: to differentiate between forms of
    00:00:43 human movement including migration, cyclic movement, and periodic movement, to contrast forced and voluntary migrations, to evaluate reasons for voluntary and domestic migration, and to examine reasons for historical forced migration. In this section we'll be looking at our first two objectives, and as we go along some of our words and terms will be highlighted in purple.
    00:01:04 Pay close attention because these are part of the vocabulary for this lesson. In this section, we're going to look at movement. So what is movement, what are the different kinds of movement, what if it's temporary, what if it's permanent? We're going to be learning about how we define all of those terms. So let's get started.
    00:01:22 The first type of movement is called migration, and this is permanent or temporary relocation across a distance. Temporary really means up for an extended period of time. So I don't want you think temporary meaning for a few hours for a few days. And whenever we hear the word migration, most commonly it means permanent migration. So this is a permanent move.
    00:01:44 It can be international, from one country to another, or it can be internal, from one state to another or one city to another. The second type of movement is the type of movement that you do every day. This is cyclic movement. These are short trips that you take, and it always involves a return home.
    00:02:03 So this is your trip to school every day, this is a parent's trip to a job, this is a trip to a store, or to visit your doctor. So whenever we move from one place to another but always return home, this is called cyclic movement. The next type of movement is called periodic movements. These are a longer periods of time away from home base, but again it still involves a return.
    00:02:28 So this might be if you have a job that requires you to spend one week in a different state. That's a periodic movement. This includes migrant laborers. So people who follow harvest from place to place to place and follow the harvest, picking up various fruits and vegetables, that's a type of periodic movement. Transhumance is also periodic movement.
    00:02:50 Transhumance is the movement done by nomadic herders who take their herds from place to place to make sure they're well fed, but then at the end of the season they always return home as well. Other types of periodic movement that we commonly see in this country include attending college, boarding school, or perhaps military service. Next we have migration, and there are
    00:03:14 two types of migration. We're going to look at this movement more specifically now. The first type of migration is called forced migration. So what is forced migration? Well, it's very difficult to define. What exactly involves force? Well, sometimes it's obvious.
    00:03:31 The government has imposed an expulsion. The government has told you, you have to move or we'll put you in jail. So obviously, that's one type of forced migration. But it can also include persecution or disaster. So maybe no one is actually making you move, but you feel a pressure to move. So for example, if you live in a country torn apart by war,
    00:03:51 you don't want to be around that war anymore, you're feeling threatened so you choose to move, that is a forced migration because it's not done 100% voluntary. Perhaps you live in a city that persecutes against your religion and you're not comfortable there anymore, you're worried about your safety, that is also forced migration. So it doesn't necessarily mean forced with the threat of
    00:04:12 violence or the threat of sanction, but again you feel forced internally, that means it's a forced migration. So let's look at some examples of government-imposed expulsion. It includes in Nazi Germany, of course, where the Jews were rounded up, forced out of their homes, put into work camps. The trans-Atlantic slave trade that forced the relocation of
    00:04:35 millions of Africans to the Americas, and British prisoners were shipped to Australia to a penal colony there. These are all examples of government-forced expulsion. But it can also mean persecution. Prior to the fact that Jews were actually forced out of their homes, in the years leading up to that many laws were passed that were discriminatory against Jews,
    00:04:55 and so many Jews chose to pack up their families and leave to the United States, to Great Britain by fleeing. But again, that is still forced because they're being persecuted. Or during the great Irish potato famine, huge numbers of Irish people chose to relocate to the Americas because people were starving to death in Ireland. Again, that disaster caused people to move.
    00:05:18 So even though people are making the choice, again, it's still forced because of the pressure they're feeling. Voluntary migration is much easier to define than forced. This is when people move voluntarily, willingly. this is when people weigh the pros and cons of moving. They analyze their options. Perhaps they've gotten a couple of different job offers and they're making a decision about which job offer to take.
    00:05:41 That is a voluntary migration. This could be done on an individual or family basis, but also a group basis. We have large numbers of people choosing to immigrate to America, for example. A good example would be Europeans coming to America, to the New World during called the colonization period, those are voluntary migrations, and when Americans moved to the
    00:06:04 Great Plains, to the West in order to settle new territory. Those are voluntary migrations as well. This is the most common type of migration we see here in this country. So for example, perhaps a parent has gotten a new job and your family has moved, well that was a voluntary migration as well. So what makes people move?
    00:06:23 What forces people out, and what pulls them to a new location? These are called push and pull factors. So first, we're going to take a look at push factors. What makes people leave a particular place? Well, there are economic factors, there are political factors, as well as social factors. This includes things like war and drought, famine, or
    00:06:43 persecution. High unemployment is a very common push factor, especially in this country today. If you can't find a job, you're more willing to move to a new location to find a job. A low standard of living is another push factor. So what makes people choose a new location? Why do they choose this particular city, this
    00:07:02 particular country? What are the pull factors drawing people to a new location? These two are often political, economic, or social. It includes job opportunities, education, higher standards of living, a stable government, social acceptance, safety, or sometimes family. That's a very common pull factor today.
    00:07:23 People, as they get closer in age, they want to live closer to their family, to their parents, to their children, and that's often a very motivating factor to pull people to a new place. Now we're going to look at a different type of migration. We're going to look at two different examples of migration. Sometimes people plan to move from point a to point b, but
    00:07:44 sometimes they don't do it directly. They have other opportunities come in the way. So let's take a look at these types of migrations that are not direct migration. The first is step migration. This is migration done in a series of stages. So let's say your dream is to move from your small town in Texas to the big city in New York.
    00:08:05 Maybe you take steps along the way. Maybe you don't move directly to New York, maybe you move from your small town to a larger town, and then maybe you move from a town to a small mid-sized city, and then you move, finally, from that small city to the big city, to a big metropolis. So sometimes, again, we move in stages because we're more comfortable.
    00:08:26 Instead of changing everything all at once, we're going to do it a little bit at a time. Another type of migration that we often see is something called intervening opportunities. Sometimes we have a starting location and we have a goal destination. So we plan, again, to move from our small town in Texas to New York, and we're on our way.
    00:08:45 But somewhere along the route, we have what is called an intervening opportunity. Maybe it's a job offer, we meet someone that we want to live close to, a loved one or something like that. We have an intervening opportunity and therefore, we end up remaining at that point, never reaching the goal destination. Next we have an example of intervening opportunities.
    00:09:10 The great migration occurred in the years following World War I. Between 1915 and 1940, American-Americans left Southern farms in search of jobs in factories in northern cities. A very popular destination was Chicago. But what happened is along the way, often, people found jobs in cities like St. Louis, Memphis, and Cincinnati. So they never made it to Chicago.
    00:09:36 They stayed in those cities and built a life with their families. These are called intervening opportunities. So in review, we talked about migration, and it occurs on several levels. It's cyclical, it's periodic, and sometimes permanent. It can also happen in several stages or steps, and migration can be voluntary or involuntary.
    00:09:57 Sometimes it's forced migration, where we feel pressure to leave our home for a new location. There are push and pull factors, including these factors which influence our decision or reasons for us to move from that place. So pull factors pull us to a new location and push factors make us choose to leave our old location. Sometimes we also find intervening opportunities.
    00:10:24 That's an opportunity that keeps us from reaching our destination. The example that we gave was in the great migration. African-Americans found jobs on their way to Chicago, so they settled in new cities like St. Louis and Cincinnati. Even though that wasn't their destination, they still found a reason to stay. So thank you very much for your attention.
    00:10:44 I will see you after the break, and we'll talk more about voluntary migration and how it affects us here in the United States, so stay tuned.

! Section 2

    00:00:02 TEACHER: Hi, welcome back. This lesson is Movement: Migration. And our objectives for this lesson are listed here. In this section, we'll be looking at our second and third objectives, to contrast forced and voluntary migrations, and to evaluate reasons for voluntary and domestic migration. So let's take a closer look at voluntary migration.
    00:00:21 Now remember, voluntary migration is when we choose to move from one place to another. Now the most important factor that we see in voluntary migration throughout human history is economic in nature. People are looking for a better economic opportunity. In colonial times, they needed more land, so they could have a farm. Today, people are looking for a better job that pays more,
    00:00:43 in a city perhaps, with a lower cost for housing or something like that. So economic reasons are very important. And in fact, perhaps the most important reason that people choose to move from place to place. So today, again, they're seeking job opportunities, or more affordable housing, or more affordable cost of living.
    00:01:03 Sometimes people choose a different reason. Social reasons are also a cause for voluntary migration. Perhaps to be closer to family, to reach a certain school district, a certain community. Or perhaps, for retirement. Often when people are done working, they want to settle in a nice climate. They want to live in Arizona, or they want to live in
    00:01:23 Florida, with the best standard of living possible for them in their old age. So let's take a look at examples of voluntary migration. Voluntary migration can involve international or domestic movement. So Europeans moving to the Americas, for example. Americans settling the West. Freed American slaves moving
    00:01:43 to the North following the Civil War. Or again, the recent domestic migration that we've seen in the United States, very commonly due to economic reasons. So when one city starts to fail economically and people can't find jobs, they're more willing to move to a new location. So let's take a look at the pattern of domestic migration
    00:02:02 that we see here in the United States. So the states in this orange-ish color, so we see much of what is called the industrial Midwest. Many people have left. We've also seen the Great Plain states people have left. And interestingly, also California. And they are moving to places that are in purple. So we see Texas is a big location, Arizona and the
    00:02:28 mountain states are a big location, the southeastern United States. These are places where people move to. So let's take a look at departure. Where are people living? And we mentioned the Northeast. Huge migrations out of this part of the United States. Over 3 million people in the 1990s and in the first half of
    00:02:50 the 2000, almost a million people have left this region. Also, the industrial Midwest, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, these are also places where people have been leaving in recent years. Next, let's take a look at where people are going. So if we're leaving these areas, where are we going? Well, we see the South is a huge destination. Almost 4 million people in the 1990s.
    00:03:16 1.4 million people in the first part of the 2000s. And they are going to the South, and we took a look at that on that last map, the South Atlantic was a very common destination: Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas. They're also moving to the West. But note, not the Pacific parts of the West. So they're not moving to California.
    00:03:37 They're moving to the mountain West. So they're moving to the southwest: Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado. These are very common destinations. So let's take a look at domestic migration. And again, by domestic we're meaning internally in the United States. Where are people moving from and to?
    00:03:59 So we see the Northeast has lost people. The Midwest has lost people. The South has gained. So Texas, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, these regions. And the West his gained. But remember, we're not talking about California, we're talking about the mountain West. So Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and so forth.
    00:04:24 So what factors encourage migration? Why are people moving? And again, why are they choosing these destinations? Why are these the areas of the United States that are affected? The cost of living in the Northeast is much higher than in the rest of the country. And one way we can tell what the cost of living is like by
    00:04:41 looking at the cost of houses. So look at the cost of houses, the average cost of a house in 2009 in the North: $249,000. Compare that to the South: $163,000. That's why you can have the same salary in two locations and have completely different standards of living. For example, the average salary of someone in Alabama, Mississippi, is about $40,000.
    00:05:09 Well, to have the same type of lifestyle in New York City, you would have to have over $90,000. So a $90,000 job in New York City doesn't mean the same thing as a $90,000 job in parts of Texas, places with a lower standard, a lower cost of living that $90,000 goes much, much further. So next, let's take a look at the housing boom. And we can see where large numbers of people were moving
    00:05:39 because of the number of houses that were being built. From 2000 to 2008, Arizona's population grew by 26.7%. So as a result, people moved to these locations. And one of the factors that we can count how many people are moving, how many new houses are being constructed? How many new rentals are being taken out? Migrating residents need places to live. So as a result, we see a boom in construction.
    00:06:06 This means construction jobs as well, jobs for realtors, helping all these people settle in. Now what happens after an economic downturn? Well, from 2007 to 2008, Michigan's population decreased by 5/10ths of a percent due to struggling auto industry and high unemployment. So in one year, Michigan lost half a percent of its population, and the economic factors are most to blame.
    00:06:34 A decrease in the auto industry and also again, that high unemployment. Almost 10%. So let's take a look at places that lost population between 2000 and 2004. So New York City and Long Island lost 200,000 people. Again, a place with a very high cost of living. Houses there are very expensive.
    00:06:56 Los Angeles, Santa Ana, California. Chicago, Joliet, Illinois. And then, San Francisco and Oakland, California. So again, we see areas close to big cities, areas with very high costs of living, lost people in this timeframe. Let's see where cities gained populations. We see Riverside, San Bernardino, California. So people in California maybe are moving to
    00:07:23 more affordable places. This area is further away from Los Angeles, so maybe the cost of housing there is much more affordable. Scottsdale and Phoenix, Arizona. We talked about Arizona on the last slide. Tampa, Saint Petersburg, Florida. And then, Atlanta, Georgia. So these are cities that saw big gains in this timeframe.
    00:07:44 So in review, we talked about voluntary migration. This is a move by choice in which a migrant weighs the pros and cons of relocating. It's influenced by social and economic factors. And we talked about those economic factors are the most important factors. Making sure that you can provide for a family. Making sure you have a job, or taking a new job because you
    00:08:05 will receive a better pay. Perhaps in a location where that money will go much further. And we talked about what has been the trend in the United States in recent years. During the 2000s, the United States experienced economic volatility. So we saw some areas were really struggling
    00:08:22 economically, and many people were losing jobs. They had high unemployment rates. But other areas were booming, like Phoenix with the housing boom. Hundreds of thousands of Americans relocated within the country, and large numbers of people left the Northeast and Midwest for the South and the West. So thanks for your attention.
    00:08:40 Hang on, after the break we're going to take a look at forced migration throughout history. So I'l see you in just a second.

! Section 3

    00:00:02 TEACHER: Hi. Welcome back. This lesson is Movement: Migration. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here. And in this section, we'll be looking at our fourth objective, to examine reasons for historical forced migrations. Well, in this lesson, we've been talking about forced migration, and how this is when people are forced to
    00:00:21 relocate against their will. Now, sometimes there is a decision involved that, yes, they could've stayed if they wanted. But forced migration, remember, means that someone feels pressure to move, that normally, if conditions were better, they probably would've stayed. So let's take a look at some of the reasons why people feel forced to move or are actually forcefully moved
    00:00:44 against their will. Well, one is environmental disasters. Sometimes when there is a severe environmental issue, such as this the tsunami that struck the Indian Ocean in 2004 or Hurricane Katrina which struck New Orleans in 2005, people feel like they must relocate, that they don't have any choice. And we're going to be taking a closer look at
    00:01:06 Katrina in this section. Sometimes it's political decisions made by a government, for example, when the British government transported many of its prisoners to penal colonies in Australia. So this is another forced migration we'll be looking at in the section. And then finally sometimes, forced migrations are done for
    00:01:24 economic profit or social injustice. And a good example of this type of forced migration is the transatlantic slave trade. So these are what we're going to be looking at in this section. And we're going to start with Hurricane Katrina. Now Hurricane Katrina struck the city of New Orleans in 2005.
    00:01:42 This was a category five hurricane. It was basically the worst kind of storm that came ashore at the exact worst place. It brought all of this water ashore. The winds were terrible enough, and the damage was terrible enough, that many of the levees protecting the city of New Orleans broke. And you can see the effects of that here.
    00:02:04 Much of the city of New Orleans was simply flooded and destroyed. And hundreds of thousands of people were forced to relocate as a result. They lost their homes. Their jobs were gone, because the businesses were gone. And many of them settled throughout the United States. So again, sometimes forced migration occurs because of
    00:02:25 political, social, or environmental conditions, after a natural disaster. Hurricane Katrina, again, occurred in 2005. about 900,000 people in New Orleans were forced to leave. And they relocated to many, many different places elsewhere in Louisiana, as well as Texas, Arizona, Mississippi, Florida, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Tennessee.
    00:02:49 And many of those residents, they found homes, they found jobs, and they ended up permanently staying in these new locations, rather than coming back to New Orleans, when things had begun to improve a couple of years later. So let's take a look at Katrina. In the year following Hurricane Katrina, about 250,000 people left the State of Louisiana.
    00:03:12 And many people, however, also moved to New Orleans. This included people that had expertise in construction or engineering. They moved to New Orleans to get jobs to help to rebuild the city and the surrounding areas following the disaster. So let's take a look at New Orleans. It's very interesting because we see wide changes in population in a very short period of time.
    00:03:34 So in 2000, that's the year the census was taken, the population of just the city of New Orleans, that doesn't count the surrounding areas, was about 484,674. Now the government estimates the pre-Katrina population at 454,863. And it's very difficult to know exactly what the population was, because again we only take official censuses
    00:03:59 every 10 years. By 2006, the federal government estimates the population has decreased 64% down to about 158,000. So we can see a huge percentage of the people of New Orleans left the city following the hurricane. Now by 2009, the population was on the rise again. The population passed 300,000 in that year. And again, that population still continues to grow today.
    00:04:32 Now occasionally governments enact population policies, where they forcibly remove people because of other reasons. And one reason is because they are criminals. So they've committed a crime. So why do they speak English in Australia? Well, the reason why is because for a very long time, Australia was used as a penal colony for many of the
    00:04:54 prisoners in Great Britain. And a penal colony is basically a place where you send your prisoners. They're forced to work for a certain amount of time. And eventually, after they serve out their sentences, they're given a ticket of leave. And then they are free to move elsewhere in the colony, find a job, build a home, or even return to Great Britain in some cases.
    00:05:14 So for the beginning decades of the settlement of Australia, convicts made up a majority of the English speaking population there. Again, they were forced to labor until they had completed their sentences. And typically, they worked under very, very difficult conditions. Harsh conditions, very long hours, and they suffered a
    00:05:32 great deal of physical abuse. The first free settlers did not arrive in the colony until 1793. And the transport of prisoners to Australia continued until 1853. Next, sometimes people are forcibly removed for economic reasons or for reasons of social injustice. An example we're going to be looking at is the
    00:05:54 transatlantic slave trade. Tens of millions of Africans were forcibly sold into slavery and then transported to the New World, places like the Caribbean, Brazil, and even the southern colonies of the United States. Again, the motivation was economic in nature. Actually, the trade of slaves was very, very profitable. There was a great deal of money to be made in the buying
    00:06:17 and selling of slaves. And then as well the work done by slaves, because people were sold into slavery once, and then they worked the rest of their lives for free. Basically, they received food, they received housing, but that was it. If they had any children, those children were typically also slaves.
    00:06:34 So you can see how much money was made by the slave owner as well. Now the actual transport of slaves from Africa to the New World was done under horrific conditions. This is a drawing that represents the slaves' transport. It might be kind of difficult to see, but this is a very, very famous drawing.
    00:06:57 And the people are basically laid out in layers. And sometimes the bunks would be three or four high. The slaves would just be chained laying down. And they would stay in that position for the entire voyage, which could be months. They weren't allowed to get up, to walk around, to get exercise, fresh air, not even to go to the bathroom. So you can imagine the horrible conditions on these
    00:07:17 ships, and the disease that would just run through the population. So again, the journey was very, very long. It could be up to six months in length. And between 2 and 4 million people did not survive the journey between the early 1500s and the 1800s. The conditions again are just horrific, cramped. The slaves were shackled together at all times.
    00:07:40 There was no ventilation in the holds of these ships, very, very unsanitary, and as a result, infectious disease was very, very common. And typically, slaves only received one meal a day. So in review, we talked about some cases in history, where people were forced to relocate. They were forced to migrate from one location to another. And again, environmental disasters is a very common
    00:08:06 cause of forced migration. And we looked at the population of New Orleans, many of whom left following Hurricane Katrina. Political decisions, sometimes by governments, and we took a look at the British transport of prisoners to Australia. And then finally economic and social causes of forced migration, and we looked at the transatlantic slave trade. So in this lesson, we've been talking about migration.
    00:08:29 And in the beginning, I asked you have you thought about moving in your future? Have you planned maybe to move for college? Or maybe someday you dream of moving, getting a job somewhere else. I'd like you to think about, again, why were you planning on leaving where you live now? And what is drawing you to that new location?
    00:08:48 I'd like you to compare those reasons for some of the reasons we've been learning about why people migrate, and why they choose to leave one location, and why they choose a different destination in return. So thanks so much for your attention today. And I will see you next time. Have a great day.
