    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi, my name is Kirsten, and I'm your instructor today. Well in ancient Greek mythology, Zeus vowed to give the city of Athens to the god or goddess who could provide the city with the greatest gift. Well Athena provided the olive tree and won, and so the city of Athens is named in her honor. Well olives are grown in Greece because it has a
    00:00:21 particular kind of climate, a Mediterranean climate. This climate is special. It's not too hot, it's not too cold. It gets plenty of rainfall, but only during certain times of the year. And as a result, olives, figs, pomegranates and grapes are all grown in this type of climate around the world.
    00:00:38 Well in this lesson we're going to learn about the relationship between geography, climate and agriculture. This lesson is Agri-Zones: Regions of Production. Our objectives: To differentiate between subsistence and commercial farming, to identify associations between crop growth and climate zones, and to identify ways in which farming has modified or
    00:01:00 changed the environment. In this section we'll be looking at our first objective, and as we go along some of our words and terms will be highlighted in purple. Pay close attention because these are part of your vocabulary for this lesson. So first let's talk about subsistence agriculture. What exactly is subsistence agriculture?
    00:01:18 Well this is farming to provide the basic needs of the farmer, with little surplus for marketing. So this is a farmer living typically in the poorer parts of the world whose growing just enough food to feed himself and feed the family, maybe with a little bit left over to sell so they can purchase things that they can't make themselves, like clothing and shoes and so forth.
    00:01:40 So typically, again, farmers only grow that small amount of food needed to feed the family. There isn't a lot of surplus. they typically find building materials and firewood in the natural environment, and they typically do not to enter the cash economy very much. Now there are very few 100% subsistence farmers around the world anymore.
    00:02:02 Most subsistence farmers today are not subsistence in the strictest sense, because they typically try to grow a little bit extra in order to get some cash. They may plant an acre or two of a cash crop or vegetables, things that tend to have higher value, so they can then sell those for cash. Often the cash is needed to pay taxes, because of course all these people are citizens of nations, and no matter
    00:02:27 where you live, you have to pay taxes. And they might be able to have a little bit left over to buy other things, but it's important to note that people that farm at this level generally have very, very low standards of living. They typically live in abject poverty. They struggle with nutrition, health care and so forth. So let's look at areas of the world where subsistence
    00:02:51 agriculture dominates. And you can see throughout much of Africa it's very common, parts of South America and Central America, as well as in Southeast Asia. Hundreds of millions of farmers still engage in subsistence farming. Again, the remote areas of South and Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and in Africa.
    00:03:12 So next, take a look at this picture here. You can see this is someone who's utilized slash and burn farming. Sometimes by setting a stand of trees on fire, the trees then burn down and return some nutrients to the ground, making it more fertile. Most farmers are sedentary, meaning they stay in one place at all times, but others move from place to place in search
    00:03:37 of better land, and this is called shifting cultivation. And slash and burn farming is one type of shifting cultivation. This is very common in the African rainforest. Farming in the African rainforest is very, very difficult because of the large amount of water this area receives. What happens is most of the nutrients get leeched out of the land very, very quickly.
    00:03:59 And so what happens is the land no longer is viable, and you can plant something and it wouldn't grow very well. Typically these farmers don't have access to chemical fertilizers, for example, which could help with that issue. So by engaging in slash and burn farming they can farm in one area, they can set that stand of trees on fire. They can let it lay fallow for a couple years and then go
    00:04:19 back and farm it again and get good results. Now many of these people that engage in shifting cultivation live in small villages and often pool resources. Sometimes what they'll do is they'll live in the village and they'll go out to this plot of land and farm it for a couple of years, and then they'll let it go, and go into the next plot of land. By the time they get around a few years later, back to that
    00:04:39 original plot of land, some natural vegetation has grown and some more nutrients are available, so they can have more farming success. These farmers typically lack things like tractors, pesticides or technology, so again they typically are farming at the subsistence level. Now the next type of farming is commercial farming. Commercial agriculture is the production of crops or
    00:05:01 livestock for sale to retail markets. Now just because it has the name commercial doesn't mean it's necessarily a company. Family farmers can still be engaged in commercial agriculture, because typically what they're doing is they're farming large, large acreage in a crop. They're taking that crop to market and they're selling it, and then they're using that money to buy food.
    00:05:21 Now typically in commercial agriculture they use technology to increase yield, things like tractors and pesticides and chemical fertilizers and so forth. OK, next let's take a look at commercial agriculture here in the United States. It's dominant here. The number of farms here in America declined dramatically after World War II, but the amount of land under
    00:05:45 cultivation remained the same. So that can tell you that farms were simply getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and this new technology and tractors and combines and harvesters allowed farms to grow in size. Dairy farming, as well as livestock and cash crops are all grown under this system, and also crops like wheat, corn, soybeans and cotton.
    00:06:10 Now this is a coffee plant, and coffee is a very, very lucrative cash crop. Large corporations, rather than individuals, often own land in many, many parts of the world, and sometimes you'll hear the term plantation agriculture for this type of agriculture. So what happens. The company has a big plot of land, and they will simply
    00:06:32 hire workers to come in and farm it and take care of it, and so forth. Often what happens is cash crops are grown on these types of large plantations throughout much of the world. It's very, very commonly found in former European or American colonial regions, such as in South America, in Africa and so forth, as well the Caribbean. Typically they're growing cash crops and luxury crops.
    00:06:56 Good examples would not only be coffee, but cocoa, tea and rubber. So in review, we talked about subsistence agriculture. This is growing only enough to support your family. Typically farms are very, very small. And farmers typically also live in poverty. They might grow a little bit for cash, but often those crops are very, very small.
    00:07:17 So again, it's very difficult to make a living under this model. Now commercial agriculture dominates throughout the rest of the world, including in the United States. This is growing large, large amount of crops to be sold for cash, rather than trying to grow food for your family. These farms typically are much larger. Often they are owned by large corporations.
    00:07:38 And typically it also includes many cash crops and luxury crops, things like coffee, tea and cocoa. So we're going to take our little break, and when we get back we'll talk about climate zones and agriculture. So I'll see you in just a second.

! Section 2

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi, welcome back. This lesson is Agri-Zones: Regions of Production. Our objectives for this lesson are here, and in this section we'll be looking at our second objective, to identify associations between crop growth and climate zones. Well, first, let's take a look at this climate zone map. This is the Koppen Climate Zone map. It's been around for a very long time.
    00:00:22 It was first developed in 1884. And the most important factor is natural vegetation, but it also takes into account temperature and rainfall. Now, when we're talking about agricultural production, the best land for growing food or crops is everything in green. These have long growing seasons, mild temperatures. So the best producing regions of the world are these green areas.
    00:00:49 Next are the light blue areas. It gets quite a bit colder in many of these areas, so the growing season tends to be a bit shorter, but these are also very, very good for agriculture. Now we have the red areas. Well, you probably recognize the Sahara Desert up here. Red areas are obviously very hot and dry, not good for agriculture at all.
    00:01:14 And then everything in this darker blue area is tropical. Now, tropical agriculture does depend. Sometimes it can be very, very difficult, because sometimes this area gets too much rain, and rain can leach those nutrients out of the soil. So let's take a look at where things are grown around the world, and what the effect climate has. So, the Koppen Climate Classification System is still
    00:01:40 in use today, again based primarily on native vegetation, but it also considers rainfall, precipitation when it falls, and the average daily temperature. So let's take a look at the importance of climate. Climate determines where agriculture is produced, what products are cultivated, as well as how much is produced. So this is a map showing agricultural
    00:02:04 production around the world. This is overall production, and we can see the leading agricultural producers include the United States, China, India, and Brazil. And what's interesting is that China and India are both huge producers, but 30% of their population is engaged in agriculture, while in the US, it's just 2%. Next, let's take a look at corn.
    00:02:30 Now, corn is an example of a crop that grows well in temperate areas. It's very susceptible to drought, which is why it fails so often in Africa, and we can see here the United States is the leading producer of corn. China is also a leading producer. The United States produces more than half of all corn grown in the world.
    00:02:53 Next, let's take a look at cash crops. Two of the most important cash crops grown around the world are cotton and rubber. The production of cotton especially expanded during British colonialism. For a long time, the United States was the leading producer of cotton throughout the 1800s. But after the Civil War, cotton production began to
    00:03:12 shift to other parts in the world, and today India and China are the leading producers. The United States produces about 20% of the world's cotton. Rubber is another important cash crop. It originated in Brazil, but was brought to Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, and those countries have similar climates to Brazil.
    00:03:31 So let's take a look at cotton production. India and China, again they are the leading producers. Anyone else in green, such as the United States and Argentina here, are also leading producers. Then we have countries in blue who also produce cotton, Brazil and Australia here. Next, let's talk about luxury crops. Luxury crops are high value crops that are produced for
    00:03:59 export, and the most important luxury crop grown around the world is coffee. It's a very important export in developing nations, second only to oil when we look at the effect it has in those native economies. Now, coffee is grown in the tropics, often on large foreign-owned plantations. And it grows best at altitude, so you need a mountainous
    00:04:19 terrain, as well. Now, the United States buys about half of all the world's exports of coffee. Europe buys most of the rest, and there has been a strong movement around the world for more coffee from registered international fair trade producers. Now typically, again because these are foreign-owned plantations, the profits from the coffee production, only
    00:04:40 about 10% go back to the producers. Most of the people that benefit from the coffee production aren't the people growing it at all. Now, under fair trade policies, 40% of the profits go back to the producers. So if you want to do something socially conscious, you look for fair trade coffee. So let's take a look at coffee production.
    00:05:01 This is sometimes called the coffee belt, because this particular, you can see, very geographic belt around the world. Now, the color here is not indicative of production amounts, but rather the kinds of coffee grown, and the leading producer of coffee in the world is Brazil. Brazil is followed by Vietnam, located here, and then Colombia, located here.
    00:05:25 Again, coffee grows best in this tropical climate, but also at altitudes between 1,800 and 3,600 feet. Next, let's take a look at Mediterranean agriculture. Mediterranean climates are very, very specific types of climates, very temperate. They get plenty of rain, but in the spring, not during the summer. The summers are particularly dry, very important for
    00:05:50 growing certain kinds of things, like olives, grapes that are suitable for wine, pomegranates, figs, and so forth. Now, we see Mediterranean climates along the Mediterranean Sea, as well as in parts of California, Chile, and the coast of South Africa. So, lots of things grown in Mediterranean climates besides olives:
    00:06:09 citrus fruits, grapes, figs, dates, and other vegetables. And often these crops are turned into very high value products, like olive oil or wine. So it's very, very good for a country if you have this type of climate, because again, these products can be very, very expensive. Finally, we're going to talk about livestock ranching. The nice thing about livestock ranching is that it can occur
    00:06:33 in a wide variety of climates. Drier climates, for example, are often suitable for livestock ranching, much more suitable than other types of agriculture. Often livestock are not only used for meat, but for other by-products like leather and wool. The leading beef producers in the world are the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Australia.
    00:06:54 So in review, we talked about crop growth, and its relationship with climate zones. Regional crop production is highly dependent upon climates. The world's largest agricultural producers are typically in temperate climates. This allows for a longer growing season. Often you can grow more than one crop in a single year.
    00:07:14 Some regions are very dependent upon luxury crops. These crops are often very high in value, things like coffee, grapes for wine, and olives and olive oil, for example. So, hang on. We're going to take a break. And next up, we're going to talk about the impact of agriculture on the environment.
    00:07:31 So I'll see you in just a second.

! Section 3

    00:00:00 TEACHER: Hi welcome back. This lesson is Agri-Zones: Regions of Production. Our objectives for this lesson are here. And in this section, we're looking at our third objective. To identify ways in which farming has modified or changed the environment. So let's take a look at the way that farming and
    00:00:19 agriculture has changed our environment. Well, in order to feed their populations, communities have had to alter the environment in many different ways. This includes natural vegetation being cleared from the land to make room for fields, for crops. Natural water sources diverted for irrigation. As well as altering the ecosystem. Because any time you change the environment, of course,
    00:00:41 the plants, and animals, and insects, and birds that normally inhabit that area, must relocate. Or live in a different way. Now one of the most significant things that people do is clear land for agriculture. And a great example is Europe. Europe, at one time, was completely forested. But much of that forest is almost completely gone,
    00:01:02 because all the land has been cleared for people. Another thing that we can see here are hillsides. We can see that this particular hillside has been cleared for farming, but it's been terraced. And if you take a look here, you can see the different lines of the terraces. Meaning it's almost cut into a stairstep like this. Which allows the plants to be grown.
    00:01:23 And one reason that people choose to clear the land in this fashion, is that normally all these trees, like you see here, help hold the soil in. And they prevent erosion. And terracing is another way to limit the damage done by clearing land. Again, so erosion doesn't destroy the hillside. So let's take a look at clearing land.
    00:01:44 Land is increasingly cleared to make room for new farm areas. And this can result in a loss of biodiversity. As plants, and insects, and animals have to relocate. It may lead to a rise in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide. Because of course, trees remove carbon dioxide in the air.
    00:02:02 It can also lead to erosion. And that's one of the most significant problems. Because the topsoil is the most valuable soil to farmers. It holds all the nutrients. And again, plants are what holds that topsoil in. And often the crops that are planted don't have the same type of root system, and so forth. So erosion is something that farmers around the world are
    00:02:22 concerned with. Now terraces are cut into the hillsides to increase arable land. We see this in countries like Japan and Indonesia, that are very, very hilly. In order to feed their populations, it's necessary to utilize that land for farming. And again, terraces help to prevent widespread erosion on
    00:02:39 the side of that hill. Next let's take a look at dams and irrigation. Well, dams provide electrical power. And they also provide irrigation. Which can divert water from its natural path into channels to be used by farmers. Now this has a serious environmental impact. When a dam is built, the silt, so the bottom of the river,
    00:03:03 the little tiny pieces of soil, and biodegradable matter, and so forth, are no longer carried down river. Instead it sits there behind the dam. And that could have a huge impact down river. Especially in the river delta areas. The Nile River delta, for example, is an area that's been heavily impacted by this type of human activity. 90% of the Colorado River has actually been diverted for
    00:03:28 irrigation and drinking water. So by the time the Colorado River gets to the ocean, there's very little of the river itself left. Because so much of the water has been taken away. Irrigation is also leading to water scarcity in many regions. Because more and more river, more and more water is diverted for irrigation.
    00:03:45 That leaves less for people to drink and for people to use at home. Let's take a look at overfishing. This is another huge concern that we're starting to see around the world. Overfishing means catching more fish than can reproduce to sustain populations on a long-term basis. Again, we're starting to see this in many locations.
    00:04:04 In the North Sea, in the Baltic Sea. Off the coast of Canada is one of the most significant places we've seen this. And the reason is demand. The human consumption of fish has increased over 50% per person per year in recent years. The average person consumes more than 36 pounds of fish per year.
    00:04:24 One of the biggest species to be hit is the Atlantic cod. The coast of Newfoundland, in Canada, used to be some of the best fishing grounds in the world. Especially for cod. And in 1992 the fishery collapsed. So what happened is in the years leading up to 1992, the fishermen took too many fish. Which meant there weren't enough fish left to reproduce,
    00:04:50 to have offspring for the next year. So suddenly the fisherman were catching this much fish. And if you look at the graph, then suddenly there's nothing. There are no fish left, or very, very few. And so it's been a huge economic impact for that region of Canada. But also, of course, the environmental impact is significant as well.
    00:05:09 Bluefin tuna is another species in imminent danger. Again consumption of that fish has also increased in recent years. And scientists are concerned that this fish, again, very quickly can go extinct. Next let's take a look at changes in soil condition. Soil changes also occur whenever you have agriculture. Erosion, we've been talking about that
    00:05:31 throughout this section. As the natural vegetation is pulled up, again, the new root systems may not be able to hold the soil in as well. Organic content changes. Crops leach nutrients from the soil. And again, the natural vegetation that those plants would decay, and die, and return nutrients. So that's not happening anymore.
    00:05:54 Chemical changes from pesticides and chemical fertilizers also impact the soil. And another issue that we're seeing is increased soil salinity. So that's the actual salt content of the soil. What happens with irrigated water, typically has salt in it. And as that irrigated water is used up, the
    00:06:13 salt is left behind. And so the soil gets saltier and saltier and saltier. And that's been a huge problem in parts of Asia and Africa. So in review, we've talked about the impact of agriculture on the environment. And some of the things we looked at is that land is cleared of natural vegetation in order to make fields for crops.
    00:06:35 Forests are cut down. Water is diverted for irrigation. Overfishing is a huge problem that disrupts the ecosystems. And the use of pesticides and other pollutants changes our soil as well as changes our water systems. So in this section, we've been learning about agriculture. Where it's produced, as well as the environmental impact. And I'd like you to think about your fish.
    00:06:58 Well, where does your fish come from? Have you ever really tried to investigate? Well there is a program called the Marine Stewardship Council. And they actually certify fish to make sure it's caught in an environmentally friendly manner. To make sure that stocks are not depleted, and so forth. In fact, 40% of the world's wild salmon is
    00:07:18 caught under the program. And you can actually see a seal from the MSC on packages of fish at your local grocery store. So if you want to be a environmentally conscious consumer, one thing you can do is look for that type of fish. I'd like you to think about what other kinds of decisions you can make as a consumer. To make sure that the companies that you buy from
    00:07:38 are environmentally responsible. How can you do research to find out the policies of those companies? And what kind of decisions can you make at the store to help make sure that our planet is around for generations to come? So thanks so much and I'll see you next time. Bye.
