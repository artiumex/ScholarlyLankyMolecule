title: Predicting the Future: Resources in the Middle East
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

! Section 1

    00:00:00 TEACHER: In this lesson, we want to answer the question, how might limited water in the Middle East affect the future of the area? To begin answering this question, let's first take a look at population and resources of the Middle East.

! Section 2

    00:00:00 TEACHER: Take a look at this physical map. It shows the geography of the Middle East. What are some things that you notice? You might find that there are very few rivers and lakes in the area. But you might also notice that there are quite a few mountain ranges, which are these triangles here.
    00:00:18 Those facts are going to be important when we consider the limited supply of fresh water in the Middle East. Water is also unevenly distributed in the Middle East. And we know that the Middle East has an arid climate-- that means that it's dry. And the mountains that we just looked at-- which are indicated by this dark brown color on the map--
    00:00:40 they prevent rain from reaching inland. So when we have moisture coming from areas of water, the mountain ranges prevent it from reaching inward. And you'll notice on the map that this is a lighter color, kind of looks like sand. Well, that's because it probably is. These are the desert regions. Now the freshwater lakes and rivers are scarce, but you'll
    00:01:03 notice them on the map. And these green areas close to them are fertile areas. That's where they're getting a little bit more water and things actually grow. Notice how there are very few fertile areas in the region. Now how scarce is the water in the Middle East? Well, Egypt, Iran, and Turkey are the only countries in the whole region that are self-sufficient with water.
    00:01:28 In fact, 2/3 of the Middle Eastern countries depend on water from outside of their borders. And Jordan-- which is this purple country right here-- is one of the most water scarce countries in the world. Let's compare this satellite image with a population density map of the Middle East. Now, first thing we want to do is look at the key.
    00:01:50 This shows us the population per square mile. These areas in dark red, that means there's a lot of people concentrated in those areas. Take a look at the map. We see that there's a lot of people in Egypt around this river. And there's a lot of people up here in Turkey. Well, what we also notice is that that's a fertile region--
    00:02:11 it's right there on the water. Now areas where there's not a lot of people are these lighter color yellows. Notice they're in the interior here in Saudi Arabia. And when we look at this satellite image, we remember that this is a dry, or a very arid, region. So there's not a lot of water there. So what we found is that population is greatest in
    00:02:32 areas that are closest to fresh water sources. And population in that area is actually on the rise. Here's a map that tells us a little bit about land use and water. Now what that tells us is that there are different things that are grown, or are taken care of, in different areas of the Middle East. In this key, we can see that crop land is this yellowish
    00:02:56 orange color. Notice that crops are concentrate right here around the Nile River. Why do you think that is? Well the Nile River is a source of fresh water. And so those crops are able to use that water to grow. This lighter purple region right here of Saudi Arabia. Remember that that was a dryer arid region.
    00:03:15 That's nonagricultural land, according to our key. That means there's not a lot of things that are growing there. So what we can tell by this map is that the land around the rivers and other bodies of freshwater have higher populations of people. And those are the areas where we're going to see a lot of crops and livestock.

! Section 4

    00:00:00 TEACHER: Our lesson question is how might limited water in the Middle East affect the future of the area? We just looked at population distribution and some of the resources that are available in the area. Now let's talk about conflicts over water.

! Section 5

    00:00:00 TEACHER: Take a look at these two quotes by Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He was an Egyptian diplomat and former Secretary General of the United Nations. He said, "water will be more important than oil this century." And, "The next war in the Middle East will be fought over water, not politics."
    00:00:19 He knew that water is a major source of conflict between the countries in the Middle East. And Boutros Buotros-Ghali predicted that water would be a source of conflict because it's vital to life. There were many attempts at reaching a water settlement in the Middle East, but there still has yet to be a widespread agreement made. We're going to talk about two conflicts over water.
    00:00:43 One centers around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, and the other centers around the Jordan River. Let's discuss the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers first. The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers provide water for Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Both Turkey and Syria have built dams so that they can generate electricity and store water. You can see all of the dams here on the river coming from
    00:01:10 Turkey, into Syria, and down to Iraq. Turkey's dam reduces the water that's going into Syria and Iraq. When Syria dams the river as well, it makes even less water available for Iraq. There have been many attempts to try and come to a conflict over the allocation of water from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.
    00:01:33 But the decrease in water to Iraq hurts agriculture in the region, and it drives more conflict into the region because everybody needs water. The Jordan River supplies water to Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Jordan. In fact, it supplies almost 75% of Jordan's water supply, and provides 60% of Israel's water supply. You can see on the map here is Israel and here is Jordan, and
    00:02:03 the river's right along here. Most of the conflict centers around the West Bank. And since the 1950s, Jordan and Israel have fought each other over the water rights to the Jordan River. Since both Jordan and Israel rely heavily on the river, each country wants control and that's what's leading to conflict.

! Section 7

    00:00:00 TEACHER: Our lesson question is, how might limited water in the Middle East affect the future of the area? We've discussed population distribution and access to resources, and how sometimes there are conflicts over water within the region. Now, let's talk about what countries in the region are doing to plan for the future.

! Section 8

    00:00:00 TEACHER: Because there is such a water shortage in the region, some Middle Eastern countries have imposed or put strict water restrictions on the people in the countries. And they've divided it up into two different types of water. You have agricultural water, which is used for watering crops, and then non-agricultural water, which can be used for drinking and bathing.
    00:00:23 But there are some positive and negative consequences of these two different types of water. The agricultural water has led to a decrease in agricultural production, which means there's an increase then in the need for imported goods, which has caused a rise in unemployment. You have people who are relying on goods from other countries instead of producing goods in their own country.
    00:00:47 The non-agricultural water has led to an increase in the price of water and increase in the demand to find new ways of reusing water and finding new sources for that water. So another plan that the Middle East has adopted is the process of desalination. Some countries are adapting to the limited amount of water by building some desalination plants. 70% of the desalination plants in the world are actually
    00:01:12 located in the Middle East. And if you look at the map, you can see where some of them are located right here along the coast. These red dots are the desalination plants. And notice how they're along the coast, so they can pull water from the ocean or from the sea and take the salt out of it. So let's take a look at that process.
    00:01:32 What we're doing is we're taking water from the ocean. That's salt water. And what happens at the desalination plants is the salt is being removed from the seawater. And we have fresh water created. Then we put concentrated salt water back into the ocean, so we can cycle back through. So this is what the Middle East is relying heavily on for
    00:01:54 its plans for the future.

! Section 10

    00:00:00 TEACHER: In the year 2004, the United Arab Emirates used over 600 billion gallons of water. Let's put that into perspective. That's about 170,000 gallons of water a person, or 455 gallons a day. Now that's a lot of water. So where did it all come from?
    00:00:21 Well, over half, about 55% of the United Arab Emirates' fresh water came from desalination plants. You can see that here in the pie chart. The water from desalination plants is represented in orange. And the United Arab Emirates is continuing to build desalination plants. Now while this may be a good way to increase the amount of
    00:00:44 fresh water in a region, there are also some problems associated with desalination. For example, a large amount of energy is needed to start and run the plants. That means the cost of energy is going to go up. So it's going to be the most expensive method of delivering fresh water. Also, there's a high concentration of salt that's
    00:01:05 added back to the ocean, and toxic chemicals are released into the environment. So desalination can be harmful to the plants and animals that live in the ocean. You can see that there are positive and negative effects of desalination. 

! Section 2

    00:00:00 TEACHER: Now let's review your lesson goals. You aimed to learn about limited resources in the Middle East. So we analyzed the relationship between population distribution and the resources that were available in the Middle East. Then we identified problems associated with those limited
    00:00:18 resources in the Middle East. And finally, we examined the impacts of relying on the process of desalination for the water supply. Now let's review your words to know. Remember that the Middle East has an arid climate, so water is scarce. That means it's really dry. There's not a lot of water available.
    00:00:36 Some Middle Eastern countries have imposed or put strict water restrictions on its people to prevent future water shortages. And many countries have invested in the process of desalination plants, where we're creating more fresh water from salt water. So let's, again, review water and population density. If you look at these two maps, we see on this physical map
    00:01:00 some of this fresh water-- or, I'm sorry, sources of water. We have bodies of water like on oceans or seas, and we also have rivers like the Nile River right here. If we compare that to the population density in the Middle East, you'll notice that the greatest number of people live around those sources of water. It's not a coincidence. Those are just areas that it's easier to live in.
    00:01:23 It's really hard to live in a dry, arid region where there's not a lot of access to fresh water. But because of that, there have been several conflicts over water in the Middle East, namely, over the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, and also access to the Jordan River, because those are some of the few sources of fresh water in the region. So as a result, the Middle East is taking steps to
    00:01:46 conserve water and to prepare for the future. It's done this through imposing water restrictions on countries. And then also on the process of desalination, several countries have set up desalination plants. But there are some drawbacks to these. For example, water restrictions in countries, it leads to an increased demand to find new ways of reusing
    00:02:09 water and finding new resources. And there's also a decrease in agricultural production, which can lead to unemployment. The process of desalination does increase the amount of fresh water in the region. That's a good thing. But it comes at a high energy cost, and it has negative environmental effects.
    00:02:28 So hopefully by now, you're able to answer the lesson question, how might limited water in the Middle East affect the future of the area?
