 00:00:03 PROFESSOR: Hello, my name is Mr. Wagner, and welcome back to section two of our lesson titled Population. Let's take a look at our objective for this section, which is the second objective of the lesson. And that is to analyze factors that influence population growth and decline. So now that we've defined population, and looked at the distribution of population on a global scale.
00:00:23 Let's figure out, A, how do we measure population growth and decline. And B, what factors effect population growth and decline. So let's begin with measuring percent change of population. We begin with the birth rate. Now the birth rate measures the number of births per year, for every 1,000 people. And likewise we have the death rate, how many deaths are
00:00:49 there per year for every 1,000 people. And then we have the migration rate. The migration rate measures the net migration. So you take how many people have migrated to a country, and then you subtract the number of people who have exited that country, or migrated away from or out of the country. That gives you your net migration rate, and that could
00:01:10 either be a positive or negative. Now population growth rate is the average annual percent change in the population. So this takes into account birth rate, death rate, and migration rate. So this is the average annual percent change in population. Now this can be positive or negative. As you can see here, it's not the same around the world.
00:01:32 Many countries in Africa, here we have an example of Zimbabwe, have high population growth rates. And this is one of the highest in the world, over 4% population growth rate. Some countries, especially in Europe, have negative growth rates. Their population is actually shrinking. And the United States is holding steady at just under
00:01:53 1% growth rate of the population, which is just under the world average of 1.09% growth rate. So not only are distributions, as we saw in the last section, the distribution of populations are uneven. So is the population growth rates are also uneven or different depending on where you are in the world. Now geographers use many different tools to look at population data.
00:02:22 We're going to look at one of those, and that's the population pyramid. Now the population pyramid is used to visually represent population data, and it represents gender and age. So here we have the population pyramids for two countries, Austria in 2005 and Belize in 2005. Now as you can see in Austria, the greatest percentage or the age group with the highest percentage of the population,
00:02:48 looks to be middle adults. So middle-aged adults seem to make up the highest percentage of the age distribution in Austria. While in Belize, we have more of a pyramid looking population pyramid. And that's because the greatest percentage of the population belongs to the younger age groups. Now this typically, when you have a pyramid looking
00:03:12 population pyramid, when it actually looks like a pyramid, that tends to mean that the population is expanding. Or it should be expanding in the near future. While this distribution for Austria, this usually means that the population is not really growing or expanding. Or if it's growing, it's growing at a very slow rate. So that is the population pyramid. Now let's consider some factors that
00:03:38 effect population growth. One is health, the access to doctors and. Medicine In a country where population has better access to doctors, and hospitals, and medicine, there's probably going to be a lower death rate than what you would see in say sub Saharan Africa. And also you're going to have a lower infant mortality rate, which is the number of deaths for children under the age of
00:04:02 five per year for every 1,000 people. So you have fewer babies dying at birth, because they have access to medicine, and then fewer people overall dying because they have better access to medicine or lower death rate. That means the chances are the population is going to hold stable, or even perhaps see some population growth there. Culture also effects population growth.
00:04:29 Some cultures value large families, that encourage people to have large families. Which would encourage or would seem to encourage population growth. Other cultures in other countries do not have that cultural emphasis on large families, and thus that would not be a reason for having population growth. Economics, also a major reason.
00:04:54 In countries where there's a lot of jobs and economic opportunities, you're going to see a lot of migration to that country. Take United States for example, after World War II, we were the world's only super economic superpower. And so we saw a lot of migration. People from around the world coming here to take advantage of the employment, and the economic opportunities.
00:05:14 And access to education is also a big reason for migration. We have some of the world's best universities and colleges here in the United States, and people from all around the world migrate here to take advantage of that education. So let's review this section quickly. We began by talking about how population growth rate is measured.
00:05:34 Remember we take into account birth rate, death rate, and migration rate. And geographers, we looked at a tool the geographers use to look at population data. And that's the population pyramid. It shows the distribution of the population in male and female, as well as it takes into account the age distribution.
00:05:55 It's a nice visual way of looking at the population data. And we also consider factors that effect population. We considered health or medicine, the access to health care and medicine, as well as cultural factors. Such as factors that encourage large families, and might encourage higher population growth. As well as economics, also effect
00:06:22 population growth rates. So that is it for section two of our lesson on Population. I thank you for your attention, I hope that you've learned something new.
