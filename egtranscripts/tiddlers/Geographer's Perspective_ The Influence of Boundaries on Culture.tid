PROFESSOR: Hi, my name is Kiersten, and I'm your instructor today. Well, have you ever tried to create a new group or club at school? If so, you have a lot of important decisions to make. When is the group going to meet? What day works best for everyone? What time are you going to practice or do whatever
00:00:15
activity it is that you're trying to accomplish? Who's going to supervise your activities? And who's going to be allowed to join your club? What happens when it gets too full and you have too many people? How are we going to decide on what new members to accept? Well, countries around the world face very similar issues with regard to people and goods.
00:00:35
How many types of goods should they allow in to be traded? How many new immigrants can the country absorb? And in this lesson, we are going to be looking at some of those issues. This lesson is Geographer's Perspective: The Influence of Boundaries on Culture. Our objectives, to examine how boundaries influence the distribution of goods and services, ways issues are
00:00:53
confronted, and who is represented. To explore the ways that boundaries influence identity, interaction, and exchange. And to identify issues created by territoriality and boundaries, both natural and artificial. In this section, we'll be looking at our first objective. And as we go along, some of our words and terms will be
00:01:10
highlighted in purple. Pay close attention because these are your vocabulary terms for this lesson. So let's get started. What do boundaries have to do with movement? Well, boundaries place limitation on movement. On the movement of goods and services, and also on the movement of people.
00:01:27
Trade barriers, for example, limit of physical goods from crossing boundaries. Migration barriers limit humans from crossing boundaries. And territoriality encourages human to aggressively attack and defend their boundaries. And in this first section, we'll be looking at trade barriers and how boundaries limit the transportation of
00:01:45
goods across boundaries. So let's get started. Boundaries and trade barriers. Tariffs are one way that governments limit goods coming into their countries. And tariffs are taxes on imported goods. Tariffs are often placed on imported goods, such as electronics or cars, in order to make domesticated products,
00:02:08
goods that are produced within the country, more affordable and more appealing to the residents of the country. So again, tariffs are taxes used to protect a country's own industry and interests. By taxing foreign goods, you make them more expensive and, therefore, less appealing to consumers. And it encourages consumers to buy products made within the country's borders rather than to buy imported goods.
00:02:35
Next, we have quotas. And quotas are a way to limit the number of a certain good or material from other countries from even coming in to the country. So, for example, let's take a look at this map. This shows you how much oil is imported across the world. And we can see the United States here. We import somewhere in the neighborhood of five million
00:02:56
barrels of oil a day. Well, what would happen, suddenly, if the United States government said, no, no, no, we're only going to import only four million barrels a day. Well somehow, that difference would have to be made up. And the reason why quotas are placed is to encourage that particular industry within a country's borders. And eventually, over a period of time, American oil
00:03:17
producers would increase production, hopefully making up that balance. So quotas limit importing materials from other countries. They also, again, encourage industry within the country, and they create a lower supply of foreign goods which, of course, also increases the price. Producers within a country can make more products to meet the
00:03:37
country's needs. Next, let's take a look at another way of limiting the transportation of goods and services. Nations aggressively target others using embargoes and sanctions. And on our map there in yellow, we have the country of Cuba. The United States has a trade embargo against Cuba.
00:03:57
Often embargoes and sanctions are used to punish other countries for their behavior. In the case of Cuba, the government back in the 1960s was very unhappy with the fact that Cuba became a communist nation. They have a dictatorship. And so in order to encourage the people of Cuba to revolt against their government, the United States placed trade
00:04:16
barriers, embargoes, against Cuba in order to, again, limit any trade goods coming in from that country. So one thing that is very lucrative are Cuban cigars. Cuba has a reputation of making very good cigars, but you can't buy them in the United States. You can buy them in Canada. You can buy them in Mexico. But you can't buy them here.
00:04:35
So again, embargoes and sanctions are refusing to trade products to other countries. And that can be for political reasons or economic reasons. And again, there's your Cuban cigar. Next, to encourage trade countries often create trade agreements. They agree to lower or eliminate trade barriers by removing quotas, tariffs, and other trade restrictions.
00:05:00
So it encourages countries to trade more with each other. So typically, we see more imports, as well as, more exports. And one good example that affects us here in the United States is NAFTA, that's the North American Free Trade Agreement. And it eliminated most trade barriers between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
00:05:18
As a result, the United States now exports more goods to these two countries, and we also import more goods from Mexico and Canada. So in review, trade barriers limit the movement of goods across boundaries. They include tariffs, which are taxes on imports, quotas, which are actual numerical limits on goods that can be imported, embargoes and sanctions, which are used as
00:05:44
punishment against countries for political reasons or economic reasons, as well as, trade agreements, which typically reduce those barriers to encourage trade amongst nations. And we looked at NAFTA. So we're going to take a little break. And we get back we're going to take a look at how boundaries restrict the movement of people across boundaries.
00:06:03
So hang on. And I'll see you in just a minute.

! Section 2
00:00:01
PROFESSOR: Hi. Welcome back. This lesson is Geographer's Perspective-- The Influence of Boundaries on Culture. Our objectives for this lesson are here, and in this section, we'll be looking at our second objective-- to explore the ways that boundaries influence identity, interaction, and exchange.
00:00:16
In this section, we're going to look at boundaries and how they restrict or encourage the movement of people. Boundaries place limitations on movement, remember. One way is through the limitations on goods. And we looked at that in our last section. In this section, we'll be looking at migration barriers and how they limit humans from crossing boundaries. In our next section, we'll take a look at territoriality.
00:00:37
So let's get started with migration. Quotas affect migration possibilities. Back in the United States history, back in the 1800s, we had very few quotas on immigration, which means hundreds of thousands of people from Europe, for example, picked up their belongings and came over and settled here in the United States. Today, however, of course, the United States
00:00:59
population is growing. The global population is growing, and the United States can no longer support all the immigrants who want to come to the United States. So we have quotas. And those quotas limit the number of new immigrants who can come to the United States. And the United States is not alone in this.
00:01:16
Most countries in the world have limitations on immigrants, because, again, people tend to flee areas that are torn up by war or have bad economic conditions. And if anyone was allowed to go to any country they wanted, it could cause problems for that host country. Now, quotas can be based on ethnic bans. But again, for the most part today, quotas are based typically just on numbers.
00:01:42
But in the past, in the United States, quotas have been based on racism or xenophobia, which is the fear of anything foreign or the hatred of anything foreign. And an example in the past of the United States where this occurred was the Chinese Exclusion Act. It prohibited immigration from China. So there were no Chinese immigrants allowed into the United States between the 1880s and the 1940s while this
00:02:07
ban was in effect. Next let's take a look at how we limit people from coming from place to place, migrating from place to place. We have documents that track this type of movement. And the first are passports. If you are going to travel outside the United States, you need a passport. And that passport will be inspected at the new location.
00:02:29
And the same thing is true of immigration here in the United States. When people come and they visit from France or from Australia or from South America, they have a passport. And that way, the United States can track who's coming into the country and who is leaving. In order to visit many countries, you need a visa. And this is a temporary permission to enter a country
00:02:50
for a set amount of time. So a travel visa might be for 30 days. You're allowed to visit that country, and when your 30 days are up, you do need to leave. They can be for education. Very common for people around the world to come to the United States for college, so they might get an education visa. Or it can be a work visa that gives you permission to work
00:03:11
in a country for a set amount of time, a couple of years, and that visa either has to be renewed or, again, you have to leave the country. So visas are sometimes also awarded for temporary residents if you're coming over for other purposes, as well. But again, these are not permanent. If you're going to come over permanently, there's other
00:03:31
types of documentation that you would require. Next we have actual physical boundaries sometimes. You can see this is a fence along the border between the United States and Mexico. So physical barriers often stop migration across borders. And sometimes physical barriers are required because of insecurity, in an attempt to stop illegal activity. In the case of the United States, for example, we have
00:03:56
to be concerned about drugs coming into the country. We have to be concerned about illegal immigration. So we have physical barriers-- rivers, fences, and so forth-- to try to track that kind of movement, to inspect goods before they come into the country. So most roads that go between the United States and Mexico, for example, do have some kind of checkpoint.
00:04:18
Sometimes boundaries exist on hostile borders. And a great example is the boundary between North and South Korea that's called the demilitarized zone. And both nations have troops stationed along that border because, again, that relationship is hostile. Next let's take a look at what happens when countries or groups of countries agree to eliminate boundaries between the movements of people.
00:04:44
Migration agreements take away those types of boundaries. For example, the European Union is the example we'll be using here. Once you enter the European Union, in most cases, when you travel from country to country, you don't have to go through immigration again. You don't have to have separate visas for every country.
00:05:00
You just hop on a train, and it's like you haven't even left the country. You would never know if you don't look for a sign or some other kind of indicator. You don't have to go through immigration again. They typically have lower restrictions between movements for employment purposes, as well. And it's much easier to cross between countries.
00:05:19
So the European Union has this kind of relationship. This group of European countries have gotten together to improve trade, migration, and security. And in fact, residents of the European Union are free to work in any country without any kind of work visa. So someone from France, if they find a job in Germany, they're free to pick up their belongings and move without any kind of work visa like we discussed
00:05:42
on the earlier slide. Boundaries and culture. Well, whenever people move permanently or even temporarily, they usually bring culture with them. So cultural diffusion occurs as humans cross boundaries. So we start to see the spread of cultural images, the spread of language, the spread of sports and entertainment activities, like movies and music.
00:06:06
We also see the spread of religion and other beliefs. So let's take a look at this very interesting graphic. You can see, here is a border between the United States on the left and Mexico on the right. And you an see that very, very distinct line. So I want you to imagine what life is like in this border area on both sides of this particular fence. Often in border regions, you find shared or dual
00:06:31
identities. It very commonly develops among boundaries. These areas tend to share culture-- everything from entertainment to ideas to foods to images and music, especially languages. If you were to visit a store in a border town in Texas, you might hear Spanish being spoken alongside English. Even announcements in the store might be
00:06:54
made in both languages. So let's take a look at language. And here's a great sign. You can see there are three different languages on this stop sign. We have Cree, which is a native language of Canada. We see English as well as French. And often in areas with high immigration rates or in border
00:07:14
areas, we start to see bilingualism develop. This is the spread of language across a boundary. Often those two languages become interchangeable in many cases. Citizens typically speak more than one language to facilitate communication. And usually but not always those are from neighboring countries.
00:07:33
And we see this a great deal in Europe where many people speak two or even more languages again, because of that multicultural feel that we see in that particular area. So in review, we talked about how boundaries affect the way that humans move from one place to another. For example, quotas limit the number of people who can immigrate to new location.
00:07:55
Documents are required. You can't just hop a plane. You need a passport and a visa sometimes. Physical barriers as well limit movement across borders. We see fences and checkpoints. And migration agreements are often in effect between countries, again, to limit or encourage migration between different areas.
00:08:15
Now, boundaries also affect human behavior. We see cultural diffusion around boundaries as cultural elements from one culture are introduced to the new location. Bilingualism is also something that we commonly see in border areas, as there are lots and lots of speakers of different languages. So people try to accommodate for two or even more languages
00:08:37
to make sure that everyone is taken care of. So we're going to take a little break, and when we get back, we're going to talk about territoriality. So I'll see you in just a second.

! Section 3
00:00:01
PROFESSOR: Hi, my name is Kirsten, and I'll be your instructor today. This lesson is Geographer's Perspective-- the Influence of Boundaries on Culture. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section we'll be looking at the last objective-- to identify issues created by territoriality and boundaries, both natural and artificial.
00:00:20
So in this lesson, we've been learning about why we have boundaries. And boundaries are set in order to place limitations on movement. This can include trade barriers that limit the trade of goods, migration barriers that limit how people move between countries. And in this section, we'll be looking at the third of these,
00:00:38
the territoriality that encourages humans to aggressively attack and defend their borders. So what is territoriality? Why are humans territorial? What are we talking about? We're talking about the actions that people take to control or influence an area or people in an area. And it encourages humans to change boundaries forcefully
00:00:59
or through agreement. This can be done by individuals or groups. Both times people show territoriality. And think about you personally. You have a room. You have a door. Sometimes you're in your room, and the door is open. And sometimes probably you close it.
00:01:13
And when you close the door to your room, you're sending a signal to the rest of your family. I want to be alone. Don't come in without knocking. I need some private time. And it's really no different for large groups of people in nations. Sometimes if we put up borders, we defend them a
00:01:30
little more aggressively because we're concerned about what's going on around us. So why are people so territorial? Well, it could be that they are protecting their national history. They're desiring better resources. So we might go after some territory that we believe belongs to us in order to get the resources located there.
00:01:49
We're protecting our ideology. This has been an increasing issue around the world. Many countries have very different ideologies than us. An ideology might be a belief system. It can include religion for example. And so the internet's caused a problem. So they're trying to cut down access to the internet. They're trying to control their population by preventing
00:02:10
undue influences or negative influences on their culture. Also, again, they're trying to protect that culture. They want to keep it the way it is. And sometimes we see the spread of American culture around the world, and some countries don't want American fast food restaurants and big box stores and music altering or changing their own culture. So we do see territoriality in all kinds of ways, not just
00:02:36
actually the actual physical border but sometimes those imaginary borders as well. So one area we're going to take a look at is here. We have the country of Iraq in green and then Kuwait in orange. And these countries fought a war over territory based on resources. Sometimes a patriotic desire to protect the nation's
00:02:58
territory can encourage people to fight. Sometimes people dispute over ownership of territory through history and also disputes over land and resources. This can include mining resources or other raw materials. Often we see countries fight over sea resources. So does this fishing ground belong to us? Or does it belong to you?
00:03:19
Or does it belong to everyone? Fishing rights can be a huge problem. But again, the specific example we're going to take a look at on the next slide is over the area that we saw here. And that had to do with oil rights. So both Iraq and Kuwait were fighting over an oil field that was underground that spread over both nations.
00:03:39
That war occurred in the early 1990s. And it continues today. Still these two nations dispute over these oil fields. They're basically saying who's got the right to drill in these oil fields that go under both of our countries? Is it us? Is it you? And of course, both sides think they are correct.
00:03:58
Both sides believe they should have access, but of course they don't want their neighbor to have access and take up all the oil. This encouraged Iraq to invade Kuwait in 1990. And again, this dispute is still ongoing over these vast oil fields that span both nations. Next, sometimes culture can lead to territoriality, especially with regard to religion.
00:04:21
This is the city of Jerusalem. And religions have been fighting over this city for well over 1,000 years. Territoriality can be based on culture and ideology, a dispute over an important religious site such as the holy lands. Again, both Christians, Jews, and Muslims all claim the city of Jerusalem to be holy.
00:04:44
And so we've seen disputes in this region over time that still continue today. So this is the line between the West Bank and Israel. This is territory given to both Jews and Palestinians. And again, the city of Jerusalem is the issue. Both sides claim the city of Jerusalem. And the dispute goes back to 1948 when the state of Israel was created.
00:05:10
And again, this is still a source of conflict between the Arab states and Israel over Palestinian rights to the region. Specifically, the one site that both sides claim is the Dome of the Rock and Historical Temple. The Jewish citizens, thousands of years in the past, had created the great Jewish temple on this site. It was destroyed, and when Muslims moved into the region,
00:05:34
they built the Dome of the Rock, which is one of the first mosques, right on that particular site. So the one site is very, very holy to both religions, and that has caused conflict over rights to Jerusalem between religions. And when we look at this conflict, which has been very, very difficult despite best efforts by everyone to try to bring peace to the region, it just hasn't happened yet.
00:05:58
One reason is because both sides believe very firmly that the city of Jerusalem should belong to them. And there doesn't seem to be a compromise when both sides claim the exact same spot as belonging to them. So again, the city of Jerusalem is holy to all three religions. Remember, this city has been fought over for thousands of years.
00:06:20
Back in the Crusades, 1,000 years ago, Christians came in to remove Muslim forces. And again, so still this conflict goes on today between these three religions. So in review, we talked about sometimes people can be territorial. And this is a big motivation for why people construct borders, why people fight over borders,
00:06:41
fighting over resources. And again territoriality is the actions to control or influence an area or people in an area. Sometimes it's done to protect natural history and resources such as Iraq and Kuwait who are fighting over oil resources. It can be to protect culture and ideology. And we've seen this in Jerusalem and the West Bank,
00:07:02
as three religions consider the city to be holy. And in fact, two religions, Jews and Muslims, consider this one particular spot in Jerusalem to be holy as well. And this has made it very difficult to compromise on this particular issue. So in review, we talked about setting limits, how if we're starting our own club, sometimes we have to set limits--
00:07:23
that you have to practice at this time, you have to be able to make it to this site if you want to belong. And sometimes countries as well have set limits. They've set limits on the movement of goods. They've set limits on the movement of people. Most countries don't allow everyone who wants to migrate to a country permanently. They don't allow them to do that.
00:07:43
They believe that's unwise. We don't necessarily allow everyone who wants to visit to come over to visit. So there are all kinds of limits that we place on our borders, and one big reason is territoriality. So what I want to leave you with is this-- do you think this is a good idea? Do you think perhaps that maybe countries
00:07:59
have too many limits? Do you think maybe we should allow more freedom between countries, more movement of goods? Do you think we should allow more migration? Do you think that would benefit us as a society? Or do you think perhaps things are fine the way they are? Maybe you're like some people and you think, actually, we need more limits.
00:08:16
I'd like you to think about those issues. And I will see you next time. Bye.
