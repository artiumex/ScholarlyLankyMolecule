! Section 1

    00:00:01 TEACHER: My name is Kirsten. And I'm your instructor today. Recycling means taking old materials, like old aluminum cans or pieces of paper, and turning it into new materials once again. And many experts point to recycling as one of the easiest things that people can do to help the environment. Recycling in America is up.
    00:00:21 We're at our highest level. Yet we still don't approach the recycling levels in many places around the world, such as Tokyo, Japan, or San Francisco, California. In this lesson, we're going to learn about why recycling is important, as well as all the environmental problems that we face around the globe. This lesson is Greening the Globe.
    00:00:42 Our objectives, to identify global and regional environmental concerns, to analyze the potential effects of climate change on environments and ecosystems, and to explore social and political trends in sustainable environmental planning. In this section, we'll be looking at our first objective. And as we go along, some of our words and terms will be
    00:01:01 highlighted in purple. Pay close attention, because these are part of your vocabulary for this lesson. In this first section, we're going to take a look at the most pressing environmental concerns around the globe. And we're going to do this by region. And we're going to start in the Middle East. And as you can imagine, the most pressing environmental concern here is
    00:01:20 water scarcity. In the Middle East, about 5% of the world's population live in this area. And yet they have less than 1% of the world's freshwater sources. Overexploitation of those water resources is a big problem. And as a result, they're faced with new ways to try to create
    00:01:41 new water, such as desalination. And we know that can be very, very expensive. Pollution of existing water sources is also a problem. Many cities in the Middle East have decaying infrastructure, such as water systems and sewer systems, which can lead to pollution. Conflict over water rights is also an issue. When you have so few freshwater resources,
    00:02:04 sometimes different people in different nations may come to arguments over those water resources. And we're seeing this along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, as well as the Jordan River between Jordan and Israel. Now habitat destruction is also a problem. But, again, this goes right back to water. When wetland areas are pumped dry, of course, the animals
    00:02:27 and plants that live in those wetlands cannot survive. The Nile River delta is also at risk as a result of the construction of the Aswan Dam in Egypt. Oil spills can also be a problem in this area, because of all the oil pumping that goes on. Next let's take a look at Asia. Population growth is its most pressing concern. Half the world's population lives in Asia, yet they have
    00:02:53 just 1/3 of the world's arable land. As a result of this fast growing population, pollution has been increasing. 12 of the world's 15 most polluted cities, with regard to air pollution, are located in Asia, including Delhi, India, and Beijing, China. In addition, many of these countries have not undertaken steps to get rid of lead paints and other things that
    00:03:20 have lead in them. India is one example. About half of all Indian children under the age of three have high levels of lead in their bloodstreams. And this can cause nervous system and brain damage. Land is also an issue. Any time you have too many people living in the same area, of course, we're going to see land pressures.
    00:03:39 Most of the arable land is under cultivation at this time. So this maximum cultivation can lead to overgrazing, overfishing, and desertification, when the land no longer becomes viable, because it's been over farmed. Water scarcity is also a problem in Asia. Asia has the least freshwater per person of any region. And they also have a scarcity of safe drinking
    00:04:02 water, due to pollution. Now let's take a look at Africa. Africa is at high risk for drought. Since 1968 Africa has been getting less and less rainfall. And two devastating droughts, one in 1984 and 1992, led to famine and death throughout the region. On top of that, a lack of sustainable agriculture
    00:04:23 practices contributes to crop failure. So African people are constantly struggling to make sure that everyone has enough to eat. Africa is also the region at the highest risk in case of global warming or climate change. If temperatures do increase as much as some scientists have forecasted, this is going to be the region that is hurt the most. Air pollution is also of growing concern.
    00:04:49 There are more older vehicles on the road in Africa. Those built before 1980 pollute up to nine times as much as newer vehicles during their lifetime. And also the use of leaded fuels, which is also more polluting. Now Europe is also struggling with water scarcity. Due to an overuse of water resources and increased agriculture, nine countries in Europe are
    00:05:14 labeled as water stressed. As a result, many countries, like Spain, are starting to have to rely more on desalination plants, which is very, very expensive. Europe also is facing a relatively newer problem, that of invasive species. Because Europe has a common market, and goods and people are free to move from place to place within the European
    00:05:35 region, they're also taking critters with them, such as the killer slug, which has done tremendous damage to vegetable and strawberry crops throughout the region. European countries spend up to $10 billion a year fighting invasive species. Air pollution is also of increasing concern, especially that related to ozone pollution and fine particle pollution.
    00:05:57 And fishery collapse is also a problem. Fishery collapses can occur because of overfishing. Too many fish are taken. So not enough fish are left over to reproduce for the following year. Or also, due to eutrophication, that's when agricultural runoff gets into the water systems, causing algae bloom.
    00:06:16 Algae blooms increase the bacteria in those water systems. Those bacteria use up lots and lots of oxygen. And so that leads to dead zones. There's not enough oxygen in the water to support marine life or plant life. Now let's take a look at the United States and Canada. Ground level ozone and air pollution is also a problem here.
    00:06:39 And ozone pollution, when there's too much ozone in the air closest to the ground, can lead to problems for humans, especially respiratory asthma, and such types of health issues. Up to 10,000 deaths a year in the United States and Canada are attributed to increased ozone levels. In addition, 40% of Canadians and 30% of Americans are at risk from health concerns due to air pollution.
    00:07:09 In addition, this region also has problems with industrial pollution and waste. Toxic chemicals, up to 5 million tons are generated each year. Now the amount of toxic chemicals produced each year is declining. It's down 28% percent since 1998, but this is still a concern.
    00:07:26 In addition, people in these countries also must deal with hazardous and radioactive wastes. Now the United States and Canada are also facing similar problems to Europe, with regard to marine ecosystem damage, water pollution, due to agricultural or industrial runoff, as well as those dead zones we talked about on the last slide. And fishery collapse, one of the hardest hit areas due to
    00:07:48 overfishing has been off the Grand Banks of Canada, which was once the most lucrative fishing grounds in the world, are now on the brink of collapse due to overfishing. Finally, let's take a look at Latin America. Pollution and clean drinking water scarcity is a concern. Decaying infrastructure, when sewer systems and water systems, the pipes begin to crack and leak, and
    00:08:13 this can lead to pollution. And many of these systems are very old in Latin American, and they are struggling with this particular issue. Latin America is also undergoing urbanization, many, many people moving to urban areas. So as a result, air pollution is a growing concern, especially in Mexico City, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world.
    00:08:33 In addition, those poor sanitation systems are overstressed, because of the growth in urban population. Deforestation is also of increasing concern throughout Latin America. We know the rainforests of Central America and South America, particularly the Amazon Rainforest are particularly important to the global ecology, and the global air-water processes.
    00:08:58 And little management of deforestation in this region has resulted in the complete clearing of more than 20% of the Amazon rainforest. And what's interesting is that the rate of deforestation is actually increasing, despite the fact that this has received so much global attention. This is mostly due to a growing livestock sector in South America.
    00:09:20 So in review, we discussed about the environmental challenges around the world. The Middle East and Africa, water scarcity is an issue. In Europe, the United States and Canada, ozone pollution. In Asia it's air pollution. And in Latin America, urbanization and deforestation. So hang on, we're going to take a quick break.
    00:09:39 And when we get back, we're going to take a look at climate change and the risk we might face as a result of this phenomenon. So I'll see you in just a moment.

! Section 2

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi, and welcome back. This lesson is Greening the Globe. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here. And in this section we'll be looking at our second objective, to analyze the potential effects of climate change on environments and ecosystems. Now in this section we are going to take a look at the effects of what's going on in our planet with
    00:00:23 regard to the climate. And this is called climate change. Now climate change is a sustained change to weather patterns over time. This includes changes to things like precipitation, humidity, air pressure, and temperature. And major global changes in climate have occurred in recent years.
    00:00:44 Climate change can include global warming. Global warming is an increase in the average temperature at the Earth's surface. The Earth is approximately one degree warmer today than it was in 1850. And for the last 150 years, scientists have been able to take very accurate temperatures of the ocean. So we believe this data to be very accurate.
    00:01:09 And there are estimates, by some scientists, that the Earth may warm at least two tenths of a degree each decade for the foreseeable future. There is also evidence that humans may be contributing to this process as the temperature begins to increase. Now whenever we discuss climate change and global warming, it's very, very controversial.
    00:01:29 Because there is no doubt that not every scientist with background in this type of data agrees or reaches the same conclusions after looking at the same data. So what do we know for a fact? Number one, we do know that accurate atmosphere and water surface temperatures have been taken for the past 150 years. We also know that a change of three or four degrees may have serious effects on the environment.
    00:01:56 Now this is where scientists really disagree. How are humans contributing to warming trends? Is this a natural effect. Or is this a human driven effect? And secondly, if it is driven by humans, is there anything that humans can do to stop it at this time? Well, as of now, about 80% of scientists believe that man is the most important factor with regard to global warming and
    00:02:18 climate change that is occurring. But many scientists do believe that, hey, our population is increasing rapidly. It's rapidly approaching 9 billion people. And, perhaps, that it's only natural that this many people living on the planet is going to result in climate change. And maybe there's nothing that man can do to stop it at this point.
    00:02:40 So that's really where the disagreement occurs. So let's talk about global warming and climate change. And one of the things that we talk about is the greenhouse effect. Now here we have a satellite picture of China. And you can see the city of Beijing is labeled there. And there's all this cloud cover. And it's kind of brownish grayish.
    00:02:59 Well, that's actually pollution. So one of the causes of global warming is increased pollution. And that's because of the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a natural process that occurs in the Earth's atmosphere. Certain chemical compounds in the atmosphere trap heat. And that's a very good thing, because it keeps the Earth
    00:03:20 warm even at night time. And that allows life to flourish on this planet. The concern is that human activities and natural processes are emitting gases, including things like methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide. And that the increased amount of these gases in our atmosphere is trapping more heat than is desirable in the lower atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect.
    00:03:45 Now high levels of carbon dioxide contribute to this fact. And carbon dioxide is created by burning fossil fuels. So the pollution that you see here is contributing to the increase of the greenhouse effect. And fewer trees exist, because of deforestation, to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. So that's why scientists are concerned with deforestation
    00:04:06 of the rain forests, for example. So let's take a look at this forecast. Many scientists do believe that trying to project these types of forecasts is very questionable. That it's impossible to plot all the different factors that could affect climate and temperature and so forth. But I just want to bring this up to show you that here are some of the forecasts.
    00:04:32 And there are scientists who believe that by 2100 the Earth will be anywhere between 2 and 10 degrees warmer. And this could have devastating effects on our environment. So let's talk about what climate change might mean for us on Earth as this effect increases in coming decades. One of the things is changes in weather. And specifically changes in extremes.
    00:04:56 So what's going to happen is cold areas are going to get colder. Hot areas could get hotter. And the effects are going to be very different from region to region. And how pronounced those effects are also going to be different as we look at various regions around the Earth's surface.
    00:05:11 In addition wet areas will get wetter. And dry areas could get drier. Precipitation changes also may be seen. Rain and snow may come less frequently, but in heavier amounts. More flooding may occur. Droughts may be more common and last longer. And this could have a potentially huge impact on
    00:05:28 agriculture. Next, sea level is another concern. Globally, sea levels have risen seven inches in the last 100 years, due to melting arctic ice. The rate of change has accelerated in recent decades. And there is a potential that between now and the year 2100 there could be between a 7 and 23 inch rise in ocean elevation.
    00:05:54 And, of course, that could also have a devastating effect on coastal areas. Now changing sea levels are going to affect some regions more than others. Of course, coastal regions are going to be the most affected. This could lead to coastal erosion. the loss of land, intrusion of sea water into fresh water, and the loss of wetlands and biodiversity.
    00:06:15 Next let's take a look at ecosystems and changes. Ocean life is one of the most important effects that scientists are concerned about. Because as ocean temperatures increase, many types of wildlife can no longer survive. Coral, for example, cannot survive higher temperatures. A temperature change as little as 5 degrees could kill all of the coral reef systems around the planet.
    00:06:39 Decreasing habitats will be available for cold water fish. Land species may also be impacted, animals moving north and to higher elevations to find cooler temperatures. Increasing loss of habitat as those dry areas get drier. The amount of habitable land for many species is going to decrease. Humans, we're going to be concerned with increased disease prevalence, especially as tropical areas increase,
    00:07:07 and decreasing agricultural yields. So in review, climate changes are changes to weather patterns and temperature over a long period of time. And there is the potential, as a result of climate change, for global temperatures to change. And specifically, we're most concerned with the increase in global temperatures. Now there is possibly a role that human activity is causing
    00:07:30 in climate change. But, again, scientists are divided on how much of this is a natural effect, how much of this is caused by humans. And if it is caused by humans, is there anything we can do to stop it? Some of potential effects of climate change include extreme weather, destruction of ecosystems, and higher sea levels.
    00:07:49 We're going to take a little break. And when we get back we're going to look at what we can do to protect our environment. So I'll see you in just a minute.

! Section 3

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi, welcome back. This lesson is Greening the Globe. Our objectives for this lesson are here. And in this section, we'll be looking at our last objective, to explore social and political trends and sustainable environmental planning. So in this lesson, we've been learning about some of the environmental concerns that we face as human
    00:00:19 beings on this planet. And in this section, we're going to explore some of the strategies that governments and people are taking to try to change the path that it seems the Earth is headed. So first, let's talk about what the green movement is. Well, the green movement is a political and social movement to implement widespread, environmentally sound practices.
    00:00:40 So actions that people and individuals can take, demanding that businesses and governments take certain actions in order to protect our environment, to do a better job. And I will say your generation compared to my generation is much more environmentally conscious. Most of you have learned about the environment throughout your time in school.
    00:00:59 And you understand the importance of environmentally sound practices. However, this movement faces significant hurdles. Many problems, for example, cross international jurisdictions. Air pollution doesn't stay neatly in the city in which it's generated. A great example is that the United States, the West Coast
    00:01:19 faces severe pollution problems because air pollution from Asia is blown over during the spring and summer months. Water pollution, of course, it doesn't matter where that water gets contaminated. Everyone who lives along that river, the whole way down, must face those consequences. So it becomes very, very difficult to implement environmentally sound practices because these
    00:01:42 problems cross those jurisdictions. There's no international body with the authority to make everyone follow pollution regulations and so forth. And as a result, when changes are unpopular, it's very difficult to get everyone to adhere to a particular solution. Economic considerations often outweigh environmental ones. Many green technologies are very expensive to implement.
    00:02:09 Many people in the developing world and governments in the developing world are simply unwilling or unable to implement those changes because it's going to negatively impact their economies. And a great example is the United States and China. Under new environmental initiatives, China is seen as a developing nation, The United States is seen as a developed nation, which means
    00:02:32 the United States' pollution restrictions are much more strict than those of China. But, of course, we're economic rivals. So many in the United States feel it's unfair to hold us to a higher environmental standard than China. And so there are people in the United States unwilling to adhere to those new standards. So next, let's take a look at political actions around the
    00:02:51 world to try to implement more environmentally conscious programs. Local and national governments plan for increased energy conservation. The bus that you saw, for example, runs on natural gas. So that's one thing cities can do to reduce not only pollution, but also their energy consumption. One thing that the United States has done progressively over recent decades is increase the minimum miles per
    00:03:18 gallon standard for automobiles sold in this country. New laws require the average automobile to get 34 miles to the gallon, which is significantly more than the last set of laws passed in the '70s. In addition, some cities have passed green building codes. There's a city in Germany, for example, every new building that's constructed is required to have solar panels installed
    00:03:41 as a way to increase their energy responsibility. Tax credits is one thing governments have passed to encourage people to adopt energy efficient appliances, solar and wind power systems, hybrid automobiles, for example. It can be an incentive the government gives you to purchase one of those things. And many places have passed stricter recycling laws.
    00:04:07 San Francisco, California, for example, has some of the strictest recycling laws in the United States. Japan as well has very strict recycling laws. And as a result, just 16% of Japanese garbage ends up in landfills, where 70% of American garbage ends up in landfills. So recycling is another thing, new recycling laws that we have done in order to reduce
    00:04:29 that landfill use in our country. So international actions. The United Nations Environmental Programme is a committee of the United Nations whose priorities include global warming, ecosystem management, and resource efficiency. But the problem is, is that the treaties and accords adopted by this international body cannot be enforced.
    00:04:50 And that United States-China issue is a great example of something that has passed many countries and yet is still not enforceable in this particular country as a result. Now, many initiatives include the reduction of carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 in an effort to stem global warming. But of course, that's very controversial because not every scientist agrees that greenhouse emissions are causing global warming.
    00:05:15 They also don't agree on how much we can do to stop it. So why should we spend all this money? Because these initiatives are very, very expensive. The other things that the environmental programme is trying to do is implement changes that will limit global warming to 3.6 six degrees Fahrenheit and giving financial assistance to developing nations to develop environmentally sound practices.
    00:05:38 Because of course, many of these changes are expensive. They definitely impact the economies of the world. And of course, jobs and economic growth often comes first in the mind of many, many leaders around the world. Next, let's take a look at food production. And I'd like to see the shape of this tilling. We can see it's done kind of on a curve. We're going to talk about that in just a second.
    00:06:03 So sustainable agriculture and soil conservation. Sustainable agriculture means implementing agricultural practices specifically designed to keep the land arable as long as possible, to reduce water usage, to reduce agricultural runoff that might lead to pollution, and so forth. It also protects the topsoil from erosion. And contour plowing, like we saw in the photo, is a great
    00:06:26 example of a way to prevent erosion. The last thing that you want is the topsoil to be washed away or blown away, because the topsoil holds all the nutrients. No-till planting reduces the amount of soil that is kicked up during the planting process. So it also conserves the topsoil. Also, buffers with natural vegetation by keeping tall,
    00:06:45 tall trees at the edge of fields that can reduce wind erosion. Organic agriculture is also on the increase. Organic culture typically uses less water. It also reduces the amount of pesticides, insecticides, and chemical fertilizers that get put into the ecosystem, into the water system, and so forth. They use natural fertilizers instead.
    00:07:09 And again, that reduced use of chemical pesticides is also better for the environment. Next, let's take a look at forest conservation. Sustainable logging practices, different species and ages of trees are chosen for logging to keep the forest healthy. The old growth and dead trees are preserved. Because of course, as those dead trees decay, they provide nutrients for the soil.
    00:07:33 No clear cutting. No just going through and cutting down huge swaths of trees. That's the worst thing you can do in a forest ecosystem. And it's the worst thing you can do to maintain the viability of that forest. And establishing protected forest areas is another thing governments around the world have done in order to maintain these ecosystems.
    00:07:52 Water scarcity is a growing concern. Many scientists believe that this will be our most pressing human concern in coming decades. Right now, so much of the water goes toward agricultural production. It's getting to the point where many parts of the world, people don't have enough drinking water as a result of the agricultural use.
    00:08:11 We're starting to see an increase in desalination. But of course, that's very, very expensive. So conserving water is an important priority for many governments around the world. And this is something that you can personally do. This is a growing concern in our own country in many regions such as the Southwest, in the Southeast as well. So implementing those types of practices in your own home can
    00:08:35 make a difference. Governments as well, especially in infrastructure, because so much of our water is lost due to cracks in pipes, decaying infrastructure, sewer systems, contamination, and so forth, that this is a step many governments are taking. Next, let's take a look at biological diversity. The United Nations Biodiversity Convention was an
    00:09:00 agreement passed in 1992 to try to protect as much of the world's ecosystems as possible. They believe that this was essential to reducing poverty. We don't know what plant species and animal species in the future are going to have characteristics that help humankind. So it's very important to protect them, especially the rain forest ecosystems, because of
    00:09:21 that particular factor. So the goal is to reduce the loss rate by 50% by the year 2010. This was essential to benefiting human life. And many nations are working hard to maintain this continued goal. Because we have not quite reached that particular milestone.
    00:09:43 In addition, many parts of the world are working to create protected areas. 13% of the planet is now protected from development. So countries are taking steps to do that. There is also a ban on fishing in certain regions. We've seen overfishing an increasing concern. Consumers can also make choices to help reduce, reuse,
    00:10:06 and recycle. This is something individuals can do. Consumer choices as far as buying organic food items that are grown responsibly. Locally grown produce to reduce how far your food has to be shipped to reduce energy use, and pollution, and so forth. Products made from recycled materials.
    00:10:27 By choosing those products, you're making a difference. And buying energy efficient light bulbs and appliances. Those compact fluorescent bulbs that we saw in the picture here are a great choice. They're initially more expensive, but they last much, much longer than a traditional light bulb. And again, recycling, many, many scientists believe is the one easy thing that you personally can do to make a
    00:10:50 difference. So in review, we talked about how the governments of the world are taking action to protect the environment, including sustainable agricultural practices, conserving water and forest resources, and protecting biological diversity. Individuals can help too, especially by recycling and making responsible consumer choices.
    00:11:10 So in review, we talked about the challenges that our human race is facing in the future with regard to our environment. And this includes everything from pollution to water scarcity. So what do governments need to do? How do we support our governments in taking those actions?
    00:11:26 And what can we do as individuals to help to make sure that our planet is there for future generations? So thanks so much for your attention. And I'll see you next time. Bye.
