    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi. My name is Kirsten, and I'm your instructor today. Well, take a look at this graphic. On the left, we have the tiny African nation of Eritrea, where the average income is just $700 a year, and 80% of the people work in agriculture. On the right, we have the European nation of Luxembourg, where the average incomes exceeds $78,000 a year, and
    00:00:23 80% of people work in service industries. So how can two countries have developed so differently, and what kind of challenges do people in Eritrea have that people in Luxembourg do not? Well, in this lesson, we're going to learn all about it. This lesson is titled Economic and Social Development. Our objectives, to define development and understand its application in the global economy, to explore
    00:00:45 methods of measuring development, to compare theories and models of economic development, and to analyze the geography of economic development. In this lesson, we'll be looking at our first two objectives, and as we go along, some of our words and terms will be highlighted in purple. Pay close attention, because these are part of your vocabulary for this lesson.
    00:01:03 So what is development? Well, development is a term you're going to hear a lot in Human Geography, and it refers to the process of economic and social change that countries and societies undergo over time. And it's caused by complex cultural and environmental factors. And when we look at development, we
    00:01:22 measure it in two ways. First, we measure it economically. We measure the economic production of a country. We measure people's income, and how much they can buy with that particular amount of income. And then we also measure it socially. We measure things like access to education, literacy rate, health care, and so forth.
    00:01:40 And when we put all that information together, we get a good picture of what the standard of living is like in that country, and we call that development. Now, it's important to note that economic development and social development go hand in hand, and that countries with high economic development also tend to have high social development. Countries that struggle economically, of course,
    00:02:01 struggle building enough schools, making sure there's enough clean water, and so forth. So those countries struggle socially, as well. So let's take a look at how we measure development economically. Well, the most common way is Gross Domestic Product. It's the total value of officially recorded goods and services produced within a country's borders during a
    00:02:21 given year. So in the case of the United States, if we were to add up the total of every car bought in the United States, every piece of clothing that we make, every movie ticket we buy, every insurance policy we buy, the cost of the visit to the doctor, and the maid service, and everything, and we we add it all up together, that would give us our Gross Domestic Product.
    00:02:42 And this is the most common way that we measure economic development around the world. Now, sometimes you will see other indicators of economic development. One is called Gross National Product. This includes everything we produce inside the country, as well anything we produce outside the country. So American citizens working overseas, American companies
    00:03:02 doing business overseas and making money in Europe, or in Africa, or in Asia, Gross National Product adds all of those factors up. Finally, sometimes you will see Gross National Income. It includes everything we produce here in the United States, as well as any money we earn from investments overseas. So for example, whenever Americans invest in the
    00:03:24 European stock market, or the Australian stock market, any type of income they derive from that would be included in Gross National Income. But the one you're going to see most often is Gross Domestic Product, and that's the one we'll be using today. So GDP is the most commonly used index to measure a country's economic health. And remember, GDP is the acronym for
    00:03:45 Gross Domestic Product. It represents a nation's economic output. So with regard to development, countries with the highest GDP are often considered developed, or developed economies. The countries with the lowest GDP may be underdeveloped, or underdeveloped economies. And those in the middle may be developing countries, or
    00:04:06 developing economies. Now, GDP per capita gives the best picture of a country's economic development. And what that means is, we take the total value of the GDP and divide it by the population. That's the GDP per capita, and I'm going to show you why. Let's take a look at this. So first, we're going to be looking at
    00:04:25 Gross Domestic Product. The overall value. You can see, the United States is first, at $14.4 trillion, followed by Japan, China, Germany, and France. And I want to point out China to you, because we're going to be talking about China in just a second. You can see China's total GDP is $4.8 trillion. So that makes them third on this list. And you would
    00:04:47 think, this is a developed country. Well, take a look at this next graphic. This is a graphic of GDP per capita. So this means we're taking the total GDP and dividing it by the population. Now, look at the United States. The United States is somewhere about here. So we're certainly not at the top, like this red color.
    00:05:07 That's reserved for countries like Norway. But take a look at China. Remember, China was third on that list? China's somewhere way the heck down here. So China's actually a developing country, or an underdeveloped economy, not a developed one. In fact, all the ones in purple, so you see Western Europe, the United States, Canada,
    00:05:28 Australia, Japan, these are all considered developed economies. Everybody else there in blue is either developing or underdeveloped. So let's take a look at GDP per capita. Now we've taken the GDP and divide it by population. And you can see, number one, we have Liechtenstein, which is located in Europe.
    00:05:49 So their per capita GDP is $134,400 per person. The United States is about $47,000. So you can see, we're not quite on this graph yet. We would be down a few countries here. Next let's take a look at where these countries are on the world map. So number six, we have Denmark. Next, Switzerland.
    00:06:21 Norway. Remember Norway was that dark red color we saw earlier. Luxembourg. That's from our introduction. Then now the country of Qatar. This is a Middle Eastern country that has significant oil resources. And finally, number one is Liechtenstein.
    00:06:37 Next let's take a look at the bottom five economies by GDP. Now we're looking at overall economies again, and we're looking at millions of dollars. Remember, the United States was number one at $14.4 trillion? Well, look at the bottom. Just $71 million is the size of these economies. These countries are all small island nations.
    00:06:59 They also have small populations. So their economies are very small, but probably, their GDP per capita is also quite small but, none of them are on the bottom. Let's take a look at the GDP per capita. We can see that the country with the lowest GDP per capita in the world is the Democratic Republic of the Congo, here. Just $320 per person, compared to the United States at
    00:07:26 $47,000 per person, compared to, remember, Liechtenstein, at $134,000 per person. So you can imagine the kind of problems that the Democratic Republic of the Congo might have with having this amount of money per person. And that's just income. This doesn't include tax dollars or anything like that. So imagine how much less money that these countries must have
    00:07:48 to work with to provide things like clean water, schools, and so forth. So let's take a look at the low GDP per capita. We have the Central African Republic, Niger, Liberia, Burundi, and the country with the lowest is the Democratic Republic of the Congo. So in review, we talked about development. And development is the process of economic and social change,
    00:08:14 and it's monitored through economic data and social statistics. But what we do know, is that those two go hand in hand. Countries with high economic development tend to have high social development, as well. Now measuring development economically, it's most often measured using Gross Domestic Product. And countries that are the most developed have higher
    00:08:36 GDPs per capita. And remember, that's a very important distinction, because some countries with high GDP don't necessarily have high GDP per capita. And China was the example that we looked at. So we're going to take a little break, and when we get back, we're going to take a closer look at why some countries develop economically much more successfully than
    00:08:55 others, and what kind of challenges do countries face if they are struggling with their economic development. So hang on. I'll see you in just a minute.

! Section 2

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi. Welcome back. This lesson is Economic and Social Development. Our objectives for this lesson are here, and in this section, we'll be looking at our second objective, to explore methods of measuring development. Well, in this lesson, we've been learning about how we measure development.
    00:00:15 How we can tell what the quality of life is in a given country or location. In our first section, we looked at ways to measure development economically. And in this section, we're going to look at how we measure development socially. Now, by looking at social factors, in addition to economic ones, it will give us a better picture about the
    00:00:35 quality of life in a given location. Developed countries, those that are developed economically, may be more likely to offer opportunities to their citizens. Things like education, health care, and employment. Many social indicators and statistics can paint a clearer picture about development, everything from literacy rates to access to health care to
    00:00:57 the number of doctors available per citizen. So by taking all those factors into account, we can come up with new ways to measure development that not only look at social factors, but also those economic ones that we looked at in the previous section. So three common ways include the Human Development Index, Gross National Happiness, and the Genuine Progress Indicator.
    00:01:19 And we'll be looking at each of these methods of measuring development in this section. And we're going to start with the Human Development Index. Now, this is the most common way that experts use to measure social development. This particular index includes economic as well as social data. And it was created by the UN Development Programme as a way
    00:01:40 to target resources with regard to poverty and health care and so forth. So it's going to measure, again, those economic and social factors, and it's going to rank countries against each other, so that we get a clear picture about which areas may be suffering and which areas may be prospering. The factors that are addressed include economic factors as well as literacy rate, education, life expectancy,
    00:02:05 standard of living, infant mortality, and other factors, as well. And this index places countries into four categories. Very High, High, Medium, or Low Human Development. And the United Nations considers countries with Very High human development to be developed countries, and all the other three categories, even High, Medium and Low, to
    00:02:27 be developing countries. So let's take a look at this index here. Now here you can see the guide over here. And basically, the countries that are in these olive green colors and above, like the United States, like Australia and Japan, are considered developed countries. These countries have Very High Human Development, and there
    00:02:49 are 42 of these countries as of 2010. And that is the most recent data that we had available when we made this lesson. Now, countries that are here in this bright green color, like Argentina, like Mexico, like Libya, these countries are right on the cusp. So these countries have High Human Development. They are almost developed countries.
    00:03:14 It would likely include countries like Russia as well in this other green color. Now, next we have the countries in yellow. These countries are considered to have Medium Development. So it's going to include the countries in this range. So countries like China, countries like Algeria and Brazil. And then finally, these countries here, from this
    00:03:36 orange color down, are the ones that are really struggling. These are countries that would be considered developing countries by any standard. These countries have a Low Human Development, as well. So we see most of Sub-Saharan Africa falls into this category. We can see this black color here is probably one of the
    00:03:55 most significant as having issues. Countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, countries like Chad, here. These countries are really struggling providing enough for their citizens. So let's take a look at the top ten countries with high human development. And again, these are would all be rated Very High in that
    00:04:17 United Nations ranking system. We have number one, Norway, followed Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Ireland. These countries, again, would all be considered developed countries. These countries also tend to be very prosperous, and these countries are able to provide for their citizens. Then on the right we have countries have the lowest
    00:04:38 human development on that scale. All of these countries are located in Africa. So again, this is the part of the world that is struggling, we saw economically. Well, they're also struggling providing enough for their citizens, as well. So let's take a look at how human development matches up with GDP per capita.
    00:04:59 Now, on this particular graphic, we've used the Human Development Index from the United Nations and 2010 data, and we got our GDP data from the World Bank. This is data from 2009. And again, there are many organizations that rank countries based on their GDP. They're all going to come up with slightly different data. But this is the World Bank data for 2009.
    00:05:22 And we can see Norway, which is ranked first by HDI, is also third by Gross Domestic Product. Then we see the United States is fourth on the HDI and fifth. But take a look here. Luxembourg, which is ranked first on GDP per capita, is just 24th on Human Development. So again, it's not always going to be
    00:05:45 particularly close. Turkey's another example. 83rd for Human Development, but 50 on the GDP per capita. Then Zambia, you can see they struggle in GDP per capita. They also struggle with Human Development. Next let's take a look at another way to measure development. This is called Gross National Happiness.
    00:06:08 Now, this particular index measures how people feel, how happy they are. Are they happy with their situation, with their neighborhood, with their leisure time, and so forth? This is an alternative way, again, to measure growth. Is the country providing for everyone? Now, this particular index was conceived by the King of Bhutan in 1972, and he used this index to measure his
    00:06:31 provinces so he knew which areas the people feel that they were struggling. So many factors included in this index included community life, nutrition, were people getting enough to eat, housing, health care, as well as education. Next let's take a look at another way to measure development-- the Genuine Progress Indicator.
    00:06:52 This measures the sustainability of a country's growth. So we're not just looking at how fast you're growing economically and so forth. We want to see if you can sustain that over time. So is the country improving in a way that benefits everyone, or is a country exploiting its resources and polluting the air and so forth?
    00:07:10 So it also considers human environmental interaction. It looks at things like air quality and so forth to determine a country's level of development. So again, we're looking at GDP, or our income and so forth, and we're also looking at social factors, as well as environmental sustainability. It looks at things like time used. Do people have enough leisure time?
    00:07:33 Do people feel free to take vacation time from their jobs? Do people volunteer or help their children with homework? Human needs. Do people have access to higher education, or security and health care? What is the income distribution like? Is the income fairly evenly distributed, we have a large middle class?
    00:07:50 Or do we see a lot of the income in the hands of the very, very wealthy? What is our dependent rate? Are we able to take care of those who are elderly? And what are our environmental needs? How are we doing with our resources? Are we using them responsibly? What's the pollution picture look like?
    00:08:06 So in review, we can measure development socially. And there are many ways to do this, including the Human Development Index, which was created by the United Nations to track economic and demographic factors. Gross National Happiness, which was created by the King of Bhutan in 1972 to measure quality of life in the various provinces of Bhutan. And then finally, a new way to measure human development, the
    00:08:30 Genuine Progress Indicator, which not only measures income and social factors, but also sustainability and the environment. So we're going to take a little break. When we get back, we're going to look at the geographic factors that deal with development. Why are some countries developed and other countries are not?
    00:08:46 So hang on. I'll see you in just a minute.

! Section 3

    00:00:02 TEACHER: Hi, welcome back. This lesson is Economic and Social Development. Our objectives for this lesson are here, and in this section, we'll be looking at our third and fourth objectives. To compare theories and models of economic development, and to analyze the geography of economic development. So in this lesson we've been learning about development, and we've learned you can measure development two ways.
    00:00:23 The first is economically. And here on this graphic, you can see a map of Gross Domestic Product worldwide. Countries in blue have a higher GDP worldwide, and countries in orange are below the world average. So the countries in blue are prospering, while the countries in orange are likely struggling. Next, we can also measure development socially.
    00:00:46 And one way we can do that is by using the Human Development Index, developed by the United Nations. And this takes into account not only economic factors, but social factors, as well. And countries that are in the darkest green are the ones that are prospering. Countries that are in yellow or shades of orange, red, or even black are the ones that are struggling.
    00:01:06 So hopefully you noticed a correlation between those two. And you can see that countries that tend to prosper economically are also prospering socially, as well. So why do some countries prosper? Why are some countries able to achieve that economic dominance, to achieve great human development, and why are some countries still struggling? Well, there are many different theories, and we're going to
    00:01:30 look at a couple of those in this lesson. The first is Walt Rostow's modernization model. And Rostow said that countries develop in a certain way, and he looked at examples of the economies of Western Europe, of the United States and Japan, and so forth. And he said that many countries develop in stages. They start out as a traditional society, with subsistence farming, and then they meet certain conditions
    00:01:56 that allow their economies to begin to take off. They start to mobilize capital, allowing for people to invest in businesses. They focus on education and government, and they become more secularized, less religious. Next, their economies begin to take off. They have sector-oriented economic growth. So for example, countries that have lots of farmland start to
    00:02:16 develop advanced farming. Countries that have mining resources, or coal, or iron resources start to develop those particular economic sectors. Next they begin the drive to maturity. Economic diversification, specializing in things that the economy does well, increasing the standard of living for all.
    00:02:34 And then finally, they reach the level of high mass consumption. The economies of Western Europe, the United States, Japan, Australia are all at this stage. People have high incomes. There are many durable goods for sale. The focus can be on things like security, equality, or luxury instead of just surviving and
    00:02:53 taking care of everyone. Now, do all countries experience development the same way? Well, many Western countries have followed Rostow's model. However, former colonial countries, countries that were colonies of Great Britain or Spain or so forth, have experienced slower development. And many geographers have come up with some theories about
    00:03:15 why former colonies have experienced slower development than the industrialized countries of the West. Well, one theory behind this is neo-colonialism. That colonialism still today influences world development. That the European colonialism's effects on colonized territories meant that profits generated in these territories were used for the Western powers and colonial powers, the Western nations, instead of for the
    00:03:42 benefit of those people living in the colony. The exploitation of natural resources, for example. Gemstones were pulled out of Africa and then turned into jewelry in Europe. Inexpensive labor was utilized. And again, most of those profits went towards the mother country. They weren't reinvested in the colonial holding.
    00:04:08 Today the neo-colonialism theory states that former colonizers continue to influence their former colonies, even though these countries may be independent. Those former colonies, countries in Africa, India, for example, continue to have stagnant economic growth. And even though they're independent, in many ways, they're still controlled by that mother country.
    00:04:29 An example I would give you is cocoa beans. Cocoa beans are grown in places in Africa, for example. But the chocolate factories that turn those cocoa beans into expensive, fine chocolates, are not in Africa. They're in the United States. They're in Europe. So again, the mechanization, the industrialization, the fine finished goods are produced elsewhere, while
    00:04:50 Africa is still only getting the profits from the raw material. That jump, turning that raw material into a finished product, has not occurred yet. And we see the same in many other industries. Jewelry, for example. The gemstones may be mined in Africa, but they're turned into fine jewelry in places outside of Africa.
    00:05:10 So let's take a look at colonized territories. In 1945, you can see these places were still colonized by their European colonial powers. So it encompasses most of Africa as well as parts of South Asia and Southeast Asia. And this line was created by Willy Brandt. He was the German Chancellor in Europe, and he came up with this theory, that if you drew a line at roughly 30 degrees
    00:05:43 latitude north and south, you could see that development outside of those zones was very, very good, and development inside of those lines was really struggling. And so I'd like you to take a look at that and see. Do you think it's fair to just draw a line and say, well, this part of the world isn't developing as much as this part of the world? Is that too biased?
    00:06:05 Do you think it's too generalized? And do you think it's fair to break the world into two parts this way? Well, it's an important theory and it really bears us to take some time to investigate this, because it may say something about the world that we live in. So let's take a look at the Brandt Line. And this divides the world between developed and
    00:06:26 developing nations. So again, countries on the inside of that line are considered to be developing countries. They may be struggling economically, they may be struggling socially. And then countries outside of that line are the developed nations. Countries like the United States and Australia and
    00:06:41 countries of Western Europe who really are the ones driving the world economy. Well again, the Brandt Line is simply a theory of a visual representation of separation. And again, developed nations are countries that are wealthier as a result of successful trade and production of manufactured goods. And again, that colonialism has also influenced the growth
    00:07:02 of developed nations. Developing nations, the nations on the inside of that line, these countries are poor due to limited export incomes and the trade of partly finished goods as well as raw materials, rather than on finished goods, manufactured goods, as well as service economies today. Finally we're going to look at one more theory of economic development.
    00:07:25 This is the world-systems theory. This one is very popular, and you will hear this often if you ever listen to the news and so forth. This particular theory was developed by Immanuel Wallerstein. And he says that countries today are at three levels of development. First, we have the core economies.
    00:07:45 These are the few nations that drive the global economy. It includes the countries of Western Europe and Japan and the United States. These countries have more wealth, technology, education, and opportunity for economic success. Next we have the semi-periphery. These are emerging economies. These are the economies that are starting to emerge onto
    00:08:08 the global stage. It includes countries like China and India and Brazil. They have a small middle class, and large numbers live in poverty, but they're starting to make that transition into a developed economy. And then finally, we have nations on the periphery. They're outside the global marketplace. These are developing economies.
    00:08:29 Most people live in poverty. There are few economic opportunities. People are struggling here, and these countries are finding it difficult to play a major role on the economic global stage. So here we have, again, the core. These are the countries that drive the global economy. Then we have the semi-periphery.
    00:08:46 These are the economies that are starting to become more influential. Again, countries like China and India. And then finally, the majority of countries, however, lie on the periphery. They have no say in global trade. They have no say in the global economy. They're simply struggling to hang on.
    00:09:03 So in review, we looked at theories of the economic development. We looked at Rostow's modernization model that many countries, including the United States, have followed. This shows the stages of economic development. Then we also talked about neocolonialism, and the influence of colonialism on the slower economic development that we see in Africa, in
    00:09:25 South Asia, for example. Then finally, we looked at the geography of economic development, and we saw the Brandt Line, which was created by the German Chancellor Willy Brandt. It was a division between developed and underdeveloped regions. And then also the world-systems theory, that said the world economy is divided into core countries.
    00:09:45 The few countries that are industrialized, that drive that global economy. And then we have the periphery and semi-periphery regions. These countries are finding it more difficult to play a role in the global economy and on the world stage. So in this lesson, we've been talking about development. And throughout this, we've been looking at the United States, which is considered a developed
    00:10:07 economy, a developed nation. And as a result of living here in the United States, you have a lot of advantages. So I'd like you to think about what it would be like if you lived in a developing economy. What would happen to your life if you lived somewhere else? What challenges would you face? What kind of things do you have today that you might not
    00:10:23 have if you lived in a developing economy, in Africa or South Asia, for example? And then what steps can the world take to try to eliminate that Brandt Line? What can we do to improve the chances of success for people in the developing world, and what can we do to ensure that every country in the world has high human development? So thank you so much, and I'll see you next time.
    00:10:46 Bye.
