title: Westernization and Commodization
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

! Section 1

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi. My name is Kirsten, and I'm your instructor today. I'd like you to take a look at this picture and tell me what you see. Perhaps you see two faces. You see the profile of the face here, the head, the nose, and the mouth, and the two faces are facing each other. Maybe instead you see a vase, perhaps something like this?
    00:00:26 But no matter what you see, it's important to note that in many cases there are two sides to a story. And you're going to hear both sides, you have to listen very carefully and look at both sides before making a decision. And that's what's going to happen in this lesson. We're going to learn about Westernization and Commoditization and the two sides to these stories.
    00:00:45 Our objectives include to identify ways in which Western nations have influenced the global economy, including the WTO, to examine the role of multinational corporations in the global economy, to examine the role of the global economy in the commoditization of goods and services, and to analyze the westernization commoditization of culture. Well, in this section, we'll be looking at our first objective.
    00:01:08 And as we go along, some of our words and terms will be highlighted in purple. Pay close attention because these are part of your vocabulary for this lesson. So let's get started. In this lesson we're going to be looking at globalization. Now economic globalization is the increasingly international approach to producing, marketing, and distributing
    00:01:27 goods and services. So what you need to understand about globalization is, of course, we are very dependent on many countries around the world for all kinds of products, just as they are dependent upon us. And today, if you were to visit many international cities like Tokyo, Japan; Beijing, China; London, England; likely, you would see restaurants that you would see
    00:01:47 back home in America, you would see stores, perhaps, you would see many of the same products because communications and transportation speeds have decreased so dramatically, we're able to transport goods and services much more quickly around the globe. Now as a result of this process, we're starting to see the dominance of Western economies on the global marketplace.
    00:02:09 This includes countries like the United States, those in Western Europe, as well as Japan, primarily because the United States helped Japan build their economy following World War II. Now Western economies influence policies and priorities in the world's markets. Western economies are the industrial capitalist economies.
    00:02:28 So let's take a look. What exactly is an industrialist capitalist economy? Well, this type of the economy is based on large scale production of goods and services. So the features of capitalist economies include privately owned resources which are used to make a profit, prices and wages are set by the market, by supply and demand, not by
    00:02:50 the government. And there is limited government involvement in business and in markets, and trade is allowed to happen as freely as possible. This is the model that we're seeing the world go to. And again, this is the model created by the United States and Western Europe. So let's talk about this growing Western influence.
    00:03:10 When did it begin? Well, it really began in the 1940's. Following World War II, the United States economy was dominant. The United States did not undergo the same types of challenges that Europe did in rebuilding after the war. And immediately after the war, new institutions were created to help the global market run smoothly.
    00:03:29 So institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, and so forth were created after World War II, again, to help trade and business and to help Europe recover. Now between 1950 and 1980, the global economy is going to grow very rapidly. Transportation costs are going to decrease. Communication speeds are going to become almost
    00:03:51 instantaneous, to the point today where we have the internet, we have satellite phone technology. You can talk to anyone around the world. Now Japan is also going to become a major part of world trade. And again, they're going to benefit from that involvement of the United States helping them rebuild their economy following World War II.
    00:04:10 Between 1980 and 2000, we see the fall of the Berlin Wall. So the Communist model of economics is going to fail. Many of those countries of Eastern Europe are going to start to adopt Western style economies. Communism is going to be replaced by capitalism. And we start to see the United States and the countries of Western Europe start to push for free trade worldwide. So free trade means no more tariffs, no protectionism,
    00:04:38 everyone's allowed to trade with everyone else, and the price of goods and services is set by supply and demand. So let's take a look at what this means for the world. We have Wallerstein's World System Theory. And Wallerstein was an American sociologist and world systems analyst. And what he came up with in his book, The Modern World System, is that countries are divided into categories.
    00:05:04 The countries upon which the economy is based are the core economies. So these are those Western style capitalist economies. It includes the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, countries like Japan, South Korea, and Australia. These are the countries that drive the global economy. They are the producers and they are the consumers. Next, we have the semi-periphery economies.
    00:05:28 These are sometimes called emerging economies today. These are economies that are starting to grow in global influence and someday may become core economies. They include countries like China, India, Brazil, and Russia. And China especially is growing towards the core economy. Next, we have the periphery economies.
    00:05:48 These are the economies of the developing world. They include countries in Africa, throughout South Asia, and Latin America. These countries play a minimal role in global trade. Typically, they produce raw materials but fewer finished goods. Finally, we have external economies. These are economies that exist outside the global
    00:06:08 marketplace. North Korea, which still has a communist economy, for example, Iran to some extent. They play very little role in the global economy or they are being excluded from the global economy for some reason, because of international sanction, for example. OK, so let's talk about the important sources of influence.
    00:06:28 How do Western economies influence the global economy? Well, there are two main ways. First, the World Trade Organization, and next, multinational corporations. And in the rest of this section, we're going to look at the World Trade Organization. So what is the WTO? Well, in 1995 the World Trade Organization was established.
    00:06:47 This is a global organization that deals with the rules of trade between nations. And their purpose, to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably, as freely as possible. So they don't want any international incident, or war, or anything like that to interfere with trade. Trade agreements are negotiated through the WTO between member nations, and they are signed by a majority
    00:07:12 of the world's nations as well. And then the agreements go on and are approved by each nation's lawmakers. So again, the idea here is to promote free trade. So we mean no tariffs, no protectionism, nothing like that. That all prices are set by supply and demand. Now, smaller countries
    00:07:31 and many experts criticize the WTO. They say that it hurts countries on the periphery in favor of core nations, that the rules of trade and treaties favor established economies rather than emerging economies or those economies that are struggling, that it's easier for big companies to go where labor is cheapest today, so what happens is big companies often go to the
    00:07:51 developing world where they can pay pennies for labor as a result, and that many of these economies are being exploited. Now the WTO in response says that they do provide negotiating assistance to countries, that countries are free to negotiate their own trade agreements through the organization, that small countries have more bargaining power now that there is a WTO than they would have had before any international organization existed where
    00:08:16 they would be on their own. And they also say that foreign investment is important. It creates jobs, it creates economic growth, and it's an important part of the growing global economy. So what can we expect for the future? Well, many experts believe that semi-periphery and periphery nations are going to gain a stronger voice in trade agreements, that the needs of developing economies are
    00:08:38 different than the needs of those in established economies like the United States and Western Europe, and that developing countries are starting to band together, to negotiate as a block rather than negotiate as individuals. And we've seen increasing use of that tactic as well. Now the priority of the developing world needs to be laying the groundwork that will enable developing nations to benefit from global trade.
    00:09:01 So they need, for example, political stability. This has been one huge problem in the developing world. When you don't have a stable government, it's very difficult for your economy to remain stable as well. Sound economic management, making sure that leaders of government have economics training. Sending people to foreign universities to receive that kind of training, and they can bring their expertise back in
    00:09:22 order to help these economies develop as well as creating an educated workforce. One of the biggest problems that we see in the developing world is a poorly trained workforce, low literacy rates. Very difficult for people to create a modern, industrialized economy if people are poorly trained. So in review, we talked about Western capitalist economies and their affect on the global economy.
    00:09:46 This group is led by the United States, and their influence has been increasing since World War II. The core nations drive the global economy. Semi-periphery nations are increasing in influence. Periphery nations play a minimal role. And then finally, the WTO, they try to keep trade flowing as freely as possible. And some critics say that the WTO favors those core nations
    00:10:11 over the periphery ones. So we're going to take a little break. When we get back, we're going to take a look at multinational corporations and their effect on the global economy. So I'll see you in just a minute.

! Section 2

    00:00:00 TEACHER: Hi. My name is Kirsten and I'll be your instructor today. This lesson is Westernization and Commoditization. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section, we'll be looking at the second objective, to examine the role of multinational corporations in the global economy. In this section, we're going to take a look at
    00:00:18 multinational corporations and their relationship with the way business is done around the world. Now a Multinational Corporation, or MNC, is a business organization with its headquarters in one country and operates in one or more other countries. Nearly all of these corporations are headquartered in either America, Japan, or Western Europe, and they influence every part of the global economy.
    00:00:44 They're a major part of the reason why the West is so influential in the global economy, it's the existence and the practices of these multinational corporations. So we're talking about big global companies. They employ up to 75 million people around the world. So companies like Nike, Reebok, McDonalds, Starbucks, Walmart, any company that does business around the world is a multinational corporation.
    00:01:10 So let's talk about the advantages that multinational corporations have in the global economy. First, they can reduce costs by going elsewhere to produce goods and services. They can bring those products cheaper to consumers. They avoid trade barriers, and this includes anything like a quota, or a tariff, or a tax that limits trade between countries.
    00:01:32 They can secure supplies of raw materials or markets by doing business throughout the world, and it also gives them flexibility. So if one particular plant is not doing well they can close it down and move elsewhere. By having plants around the world, if there's unrest or a natural disaster, the entire operation isn't wiped out, just one specific area is.
    00:01:54 So it gives corporations a great deal of flexibility to operate around the world. And again, it gives consumers a great deal of advantages, too, because typically we pay less for goods and services. We pay less for our clothing, and our televisions, and other goods that we would like to buy. Now it also gives host countries advantages. It promotes economic growth within that host country.
    00:02:16 A transfer technology. What often happens is that as these big companies come in and build plants in places like China and Taiwan, the people of China learn new skills and those skills can be applied to other companies within China. So China has been a big beneficiary of this type of set up. They have a very skilled workforce now, as a result of
    00:02:37 so much investment in their country. And they've taken much of that technology and turned it around and built Chinese companies with that. So it's a win-win situation in many cases. In addition, they provide lower priced higher quality goods for consumers, not only for the export market, but also for people living within that country. They too get access to these goods, often at a
    00:02:59 much cheaper price. So again, there is some advantages for people around the world. They do bring jobs. The criticism might be that the jobs aren't well-paying by American standards, but there's certainly well-paying by typically the standard of that country. There are jobs there.
    00:03:17 They also can help reduce poverty and the like. But of course, there are going to be some criticisms of multinational corporations. And so let's take a look at those. One big criticism is that operations often cause pollution and environmental damage. What often happens is corporations operate in countries with very loose environmental standards
    00:03:38 because it's cheaper to do business that way, cheaper to do business there. And so as a result, polluted countries get even more polluted. Next, employment issues resulting in increased unemployment in core countries. Many labor unions in the United States or in Western Europe, for example, will cite this as a reason for rising
    00:03:58 unemployment in these countries. Very low wages take advantage of poverty in periphery nations. So the next argument would be, OK, so you're paying that person $0.20 an hour. You're not really doing that much to alleviate poverty there when you're paying them such a low wage. So even though it's a job and the wages are probably
    00:04:17 comparable to other jobs in that country, we look at that and say, $0.20 an hour, that's unconscionable. Because of course in this country, in a factory you would likely pay someone $12 or $14 an hour. The size and the economic power of MNCs can be used to unduly influence government. And unduly means unfairly or too much influence. And what that means is a company can go in with one
    00:04:44 country, and they'll say, you take our deal or we're going to take it to the country next door. And that often happens. And so because these companies are so powerful, they're so big, and they have so many jobs to offer, that sometimes countries make deals that are unfair to them just because of threats from that corporation to take business elsewhere. Finally, they're not accountable to any one
    00:05:04 government. Again, they're not accountable to the laws of the United States when they're operating in China. They're not accountable to the laws of Japan when they're working in Indonesia. So that's one big criticism is that there's no one being a watchdog for these organizations, that some of the practices that they're using are unfair or immoral or
    00:05:24 unconscionable, and there's no one that we can hold accountable because they're operating in so many countries. So one organization that's really trying to change the way that multinational corporations do business is the United Nations. And the United Nations Global Compact Program was really created in response to activist concerns about MNCs.
    00:05:46 So activists are those people who speak out against injustice. And activists in this case, those who oppose the actions of multinational corporations. Sometimes they oppose the actions of the World Trade Organization. They believe that, in many cases, these countries are not getting a fair deal, that they're being taken advantage
    00:06:04 of, that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. They bring global attention to immoral practices, unjust practices, or corrupt practices in order to enact change. So in order to belong to this program, multinational corporations enter what is called a compact. So this is an agreement, and it's a list of rules that they
    00:06:25 agree to abide by. They agree to uphold basic human rights, environmental standards, and labor principles. So it includes things like the protection of human rights, that they should protect human rights laws as practiced around the world. So no forced labor, no slave labor, no child labor, eliminating those from multinational corporation
    00:06:47 factories and other job positions. Allowing collective bargaining and union organization within their companies. Greater environmental responsibility, looking for new ways to treat the environment more respectfully and to spread that technology to the new country. And also to eliminate corruption and bribery, quit bribing officials in countries to allow you to do business
    00:07:12 there and the like. So again, trying to do business in a more ethical manner and a more environmentally responsible manner and a more moral manner. They allow private groups to monitor their compliance to the rules that they've agreed to. And the program includes over 5,300 businesses that operate in 130 countries.
    00:07:31 So in review, multinational corporations are a major reason for the West's influence in the global economy. They offer economic and technological advantages for host countries, including a bigger skilled workforce, new technology that can then be adopted and applied to companies of that host nation. Now, business decisions of MNCs have been a source of
    00:07:52 concern, because often they skirt environmental laws by operating in countries that have very lax regulation. So sometimes they're polluting, they're dumping, and the like. Sometimes their labor practices are unfair. They're not paying people decent enough wages. Often child labor has been an issue in some of these corporations.
    00:08:11 And also, their influence over national governments is seen as unfair, because they're so rich and wealthy and they have so much, they can go in and make these agreements that are often unfair to the people of the host country. So the UN Global Compact was a way for companies to get together to come up with some ethical practices to do business around the world. So it includes protecting human rights, protecting the
    00:08:36 environment, and doing business in an ethical and moral manner. So thank you very much, and I'll see you next time. Bye.

! Section 3

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi, welcome back. This lesson is Westernization and Commoditization. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here. And in this section, we'll be looking at our third and fourth objectives, to examine the role of the global economy and the commoditization of goods and services and to analyze the westernization and commoditization of culture. In this section, we're going to look at globalization and
    00:00:24 how that has changed what people wear, the TV shows they watch, the movies they see, and so forth as a result. What we're starting to see is something called cultural globalization. What is cultural globalization? It's seen by many as the homogenization and Westernization of world culture. Wow, that's a mouthful.
    00:00:46 What does that mean? Well that means that culture around the world is increasingly getting the same, so if you were to visit a city in Europe, or a city in Japan, or a city of China, you would see the same clothing. You would see the same suits. You might see the same TV shows on TV, maybe translated, and you'd see the same movies in the movie theater.
    00:01:07 So homogenization means culture around the world is getting to be the same. Now Westernization means that culture is coming from the West. So it's coming from Western Europe. It's coming from the United States and Canada. Now others see, however, globalization as a sharing and mixing of cultures. They point out that kids in America love Japanese anime.
    00:01:29 They like Latin American music. They like things from other countries as well like Chinese food and Japanese food and sushi for example. So instead, they don't see it as Westernization so much as that people are sharing culture around the world. So think about that, and think about what you think is actually occurring. Let's take a look, first, at globalization as
    00:01:51 Westernization. Here is a quote from the UN Human Development Report. It says, "there are the global teens-- some 270 million 15 to 18-year-olds in 40 countries-- inhabiting a global space, a single pop-culture world soaking up the same videos and music and providing a huge market for designer running shoes, t-shirts and jeans." So what the United Nations is saying here is that there are
    00:02:17 270 million kids around the world listening to the same music and buying the same clothes and that these products are coming from the West. Now some critics will say it's not that they're coming from the West, but it's coming from those corporations, those multinational corporations who just happen to be based in the West. So it's not really driven by the countries, per say, as it's driven by those corporations.
    00:02:41 These corporations are looking for expanding their markets. New regions for sales and the developing world means billions of dollars and billions of potential customers. And often what's happening is these corporations are adapting their products to meet the regional taste. So they're taking a pizza and they're putting local types of things on it, making it flavored more like local
    00:03:05 cuisine or with local toppings. Or they're taking clothing, for example, and they're adapting it to fit regional tastes. This is viewed by many people around the world as a threat, including those who fear that Western culture is going to supplant indigenous culture and take over, or those who feel that Western culture is incompatible with traditional belief systems. This is a growing concern in the Muslim
    00:03:28 world, again a very traditional culture, a very conservative culture especially with regard to clothing and behavior and dress. And many people in the Muslim world see the Westernization of culture that's starting to come into their region as incompatible with being a devout Muslim. Let's take a look at globalization as culture creation.
    00:03:50 Again, remember one side says that globalization means that we're all becoming like the West. The other side says, no, no, no. What we're starting to do is merge everybody's beliefs and wants and ideas and trends into one new global culture. The rapid travel of ideas, attitudes, and values across national borders has meant that our cultures are becoming more connected.
    00:04:15 Proponents see this as a positive contribution of Western civilization to the world. So the fact that we're so embracing of other cultures, the fact that we're starting to investigate what people do around the world and maybe adopt it for our own is a good thing, and it's one of the things that the West has contributed to the advancement of humankind. This is a direct result of interconnectedness and
    00:04:37 interaction between global customers and between global villages. So for example, today you can play a game online, on your Xbox 360, using Xbox Live, and you can play against a kid living in Europe or a kid living in Japan. Information, ideas, everything spreads so quickly now. What used to take decades, a new idea might take 100 years to
    00:05:03 spread across the world, now can be done in a matter of moments. We have increased cultural diversity as a result. And again, new business models are spread allowing for economic growth everywhere. Let's take a look at commoditization next. Commoditization means that when we are, again, packaging something so it can be sold really easily, one thing that
    00:05:27 we're starting to see is the commoditization of culture. Here's a great example. We have some Hawaiian or Polynesian girls doing a dance. And look at their costume. It's brightly colored, and everything's perfect, and their headbands are all matching. This is probably not a very realistic depiction of a
    00:05:45 traditional dance as far as the costume is concerned, but it sure looks good. And that is the commoditization of culture. We're packaging culture for consumption by people. Again, packaging, marketing, and promoting a culture for sale. It often requires transforming ethnic goods and behaviors for mass appeal.
    00:06:04 It's the theme-parking of culture, and of course it's going to have a result in diminishing the authentic cultural diversity, diminishing what the actual culture might perhaps be by packaging it in a way like this. There are some negative points. Next let's talk about the commoditization of products and services.
    00:06:25 Commoditization occurs when competitors' products and services become very similar, and price is often the only factor in selection. So a great example might be notebook paper or printer paper. You don't really probably go out and buy a particular brand of printer paper. You probably don't care.
    00:06:41 You just go and find the cheapest printer paper you can find, or pencils, or anything like that. We're starting to see this with, for example, electronics. A lot of people care less, perhaps, about their DVD player. They just want a cheap DVD player, and when it breaks, they'll throw it away and buy a new one.
    00:06:58 Or TV, or computers. This is what happens when products become very, very similar. People start caring only about price rather than the individual features. We're starting to see an acceleration of this process as a result of the global marketplace. We're seeing it in communication and
    00:07:15 transportation advancements. We see fewer trade barriers, standardized processes. When all TVs are built in exactly the same way, it's very difficult to make them different from each other. And the worldwide web makes comparison shopping easy. So if you want to buy a new TV, you likely go online, you check out the prices at all the stories in your area, and then you go make your selection.
    00:07:37 Again, people can go and compare shop easy, so we're starting to see the commoditization occur. What are the upsides and downsides? Well, commoditization helps people who want goods and services without guesswork, they want the lowest possible price. It also help firms entering a market. If you're a new TV producer, it doesn't matter if no one's
    00:07:57 heard of your name. People don't care. They're looking for the best price. And it may include start-up businesses in developing economies. So we see this, perhaps, as something that can help the developing world. However, commoditization can also hurt.
    00:08:11 It hurts consumers, for example, who want a wide variety of features, if you want a lot of choice. It hurts firms who are first to bring the good or service to market, because what happens is, very quickly, everyone else copies what you've invented. And it also hurts those who attempt to bring an innovation to something that consumers have accepted as a commodity. A commodity is one of those goods that we don't care about
    00:08:35 what the features are, we only care about price. So if you come up with a great idea to make it better, it's very difficult to make consumers understand how your innovation is different from what they're already seeing. Let's talk about branding. Brand is the repeated and consistent communication identity of a firm. So a brand can be a commercial.
    00:08:57 It can be an actual emblem or symbol on a good. It's a way to make your particular good stand out. For example, a tennis shoe. You can buy an athletic shoe, or you can buy a certain brand with a swoosh on it which is special. And if you buy that particular shoe, you will be like Michael Jordan or some of the great athletes of the world. So branding is done to differentiate the firm from
    00:09:21 other firms who create the same product. And a brand communicates an image in the mind of the consumer. So it's important for branding to occur to rise above the competition when you are selling a commodity. So there are certain, perhaps, brands of televisions or brands of other commodities that we've discussed that maybe stick out in your mind.
    00:09:40 Think about why those brands stick out in your mind. Is it the commercials? Or is it their reliability? Or what is it? Consumers often seek out the products of companies they prefer, so branding can be successful. So in review, we talked about cultural globalization. It's seen by some as a large-scale homogenization and
    00:09:57 westernization of culture. So culture is beginning to be all the same no matter where in the world you are. And it's seen by others as a way of promoting cultural interaction and diversity. We also talked about commoditization, packaging cultures for promotion to tourists. Many products are difficult to distinguish from each other
    00:10:15 except by price, and this results in a product being seen as a commodity. And branding is used to counteract this process of commoditization. In review, I want you to take out of this that you've learned that you are an important player in the global market. The clothes you choose, the music you listen to, and the TV shows that you watch are then packaged for sale in
    00:10:37 other countries around the world. So think about the choices that you're making with regard to clothing and television and music. What message are these choices sending? Are they saying what you want them to say? And are you helping to create the world in which you want to live? Thanks so much, and I'll see you next time.
