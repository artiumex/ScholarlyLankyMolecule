! Section 1

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi, my name is Kirsten, and I am your instructor today. Well, the temple pictured here is the temple called Abu Simbel. It was built by the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II in honor of himself and his wife Nefertari as well as in honor of several Egyptian gods. Now this is one of Egypt's most treasured archaeological
    00:00:21 sites, but what's interesting is that between the years 1964 and 1966, a UN and Egyptian effort moved this temple 200 feet up the side of a cliff where it now resides on the banks of the Nile River. They built two artificial mountains to cover the temple, and you can see the location here in comparison to where it was located before. Its old location would have been covered by water.
    00:00:50 So why did this occur? Why did this temple have to be moved? How did the water end up covering up the old temple location, and what does this all have to do with the way that humans alter their environment? Well, in this lesson we're going to learn all about it. This lesson is titled Altering the Environment. Our objectives:
    00:01:10 to examine techniques that humans have used to physically alter the natural environment, to analyze technologies humans have developed to survive and thrive in environments. In this section we'll be looking at our first objective, and as we go along some of our words and terms will be highlighted in purple. Pay close attention, because these are part of your vocabulary for this lesson.
    00:01:31 Well, this is the Nile River, and the Nile River has been vital to the survival of human life in Egypt for thousands of years. It is the world's longest river at a little more than 4,000 miles. And of course the Nile was home to the early ancient Egyptian civilization, one of the most advanced civilizations up until that point.
    00:01:53 Harnessing the Nile and using it for agriculture is one of the most important reasons why this civilization developed here in the middle of the Egyptian desert. Now in ancient times the Nile would overflow its banks each and every summer like clockwork, bringing silt from the bottom of the river up into the farmland and making the farmland extremely fertile throughout the river valley. That resulted in huge agricultural yields, allowing
    00:02:21 the Egyptians to trade things like flax and wheat that were grown on the shores of the Nile. As a result, Egypt was known as an agricultural hearth, a place where the cultivation of agriculture began in world history and enabled huge civilizations, advanced civilizations full of trade goods, to develop because of that huge surplus in agriculture. However, along with the seasonal flooding that
    00:02:50 happened each and every year there was great danger. Yearly floods sometimes might be too big, wiping out homes and crops because of too much water. Or sometimes droughts in the upper mountain regions would result in too little floodwaters, which would often lead to starvation in ancient Egypt. As a result, often the people of Egypt turned to ways to harness the Nile more effectively.
    00:03:16 How could they control these floodwaters so they could benefit from them and yet not have their crops destroyed? So levees and embankments were constructed. And a levee is a tall wall designed to control the flow of water in an area. Embankments are earth structures located along river banks. And both of these type of structures provide simple
    00:03:40 protection against flooding. They often enabled settlements to exist below the river's level, because what would happen is as the earth would sink, people could still live at those lower elevations as long as there was something there to protect them from the floodwaters. And we saw what can happen sometimes when that land begins to sink in cities like New Orleans
    00:04:02 when the levees failed. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, much of New Orleans was flooded as a result, causing a great destruction, loss of life, as well as loss of property. In addition, the Egyptian people constructed canals and aqueducts. They channeled water away from the river towards more areas where they could have more farmland, away from
    00:04:25 flood-prone zones in order to make sure that the crops that were planted survive. In addition, these channels as well the Nile River provided methods of transportation for goods and travels, and they were often used also to transport water supplies to the people of Egypt. However, these early levees and embankments and early channels did nothing to protect the cities from huge
    00:04:52 floods or from drought, because sometimes remember the flood didn't occur enough, and that meant there wasn't enough rainfall up in the mountains. And often that would result in widespread famine, because there wasn't enough water to water the crops that year. So two big problems. How do we control the flood so we don't destroy property, and then how do we get enough water during droughts?
    00:05:15 Well, the answer to that was storing water. Civilizations, not just the Egyptian but other civilizations, build dams and reservoirs to regulate the flow of a river. A reservoir is a man-made structure used to store water for times of drought. Usually lakes are formed behind dams for that purpose. Water is let out at a predictable rate, which can
    00:05:41 prevent horrible, horrible floods. But then that lake can also provide recreational resources. So many of the lakes in the United States today are reservoirs. They are built behind dams, and people use them for boating, and water skiing, and swimming, and the like, but again they're a great source of water in times of drought,
    00:05:59 because then the water can be filtered and used to water crops, or for human consumption and the like. Now in addition, we can store water for years when we don't get enough rainfall. Then we can also use water running through that dam to generate electricity. And this is another important reason for dams here in America as well as throughout the world.
    00:06:22 As that water pushes through the dam, it spins turbines, and that's how we get electrical power not only in America but elsewhere around the world. So let's take a look at the Aswan dams. There were two dams built on the Nile river. The first was the Low Dam. It was built in the 1800s during the British conquest of the region.
    00:06:44 But the problem was the dam was not high enough, and often when floodwaters were too high, they would simply overspill the dam. Well, in order to correct that, the Egyptian government decided to build a much, much higher dam. They were going to do it further up the Nile. And they were going to build a big reservoir as well, because this High Dam would cause, as you can see on the right hand
    00:07:06 side, a big lake to form, and the water would be let out gradually. There was one big problem. There was a great monument located where the new lake was going to form, and the lake is Lake Nasser. And of course, that monument was Abu Simbel. So in order to save that monument from the new lake that was going to be formed, the United Nations and the
    00:07:26 Egyptian government worked together to relocate that monument up the side of the cliff to position it exactly the way it was positioned before, to rebuild it piece by piece. Then they covered it up with artificial mountains, preserving the look that that monument had against the cliff side. The dam was built, and then the old site was flooded in.
    00:07:49 Now the Aswan Dam was constructed between 1960 and 1970. It was constructed on the southern border of Egypt near Sudan, and it was built above the previous dam that had existed. So this is the High Dam, where the old dam is considered the Low Dam. The costs were in excess of $1 billion, and the Egyptians got
    00:08:10 help from the government of the Soviet Union to construct that dam. Now after the dam was constructed, a new reservoir was created, Lake Nasser. It's one of the world's largest artificial lakes. And what's interesting is that because the Egyptian climate is so hot, as a result of having this huge lake, one of the big problems that it created that no one could
    00:08:32 foresee was the evaporation effect. Now a huge amount of water each year is lost to evaporation because of the large size of the lake. Also however, in addition to displacing the monument of Abu Simbel, it also displaced thousands of Egyptian residents. About 50,000 people in Egypt and Sudan had to move because their homes and farms were going to be underwater.
    00:09:00 So let's take a look at the effects of the High Dam. Remember, the dam was constructed to help with two problems. Number one, a way to store water in times of drought. The old dam didn't really do that. And now in history since the dam has been constructed, for example a horrible, horrible drought ravaged Ethiopia and Sudan in 1984.
    00:09:23 Well, Egypt was spared because they had that reservoir. They could let more water out during that exceptionally dry period. So they did not starve. They were able to still water their crops and be fine. So that's the first thing it did. The second thing it was designed to do was control flooding.
    00:09:38 No longer could the water overflow this particular dam. It's much too high. And it was effective in controlling flooding. So let's talk about some of the effects of the High Dam. First, a new source of energy, hydroelectric power plants, were attached to the new dam, and today they produce about 15% of Egypt's electricity. They also eliminated that seasonal flooding, so again,
    00:10:02 crops would no longer be damaged by flooding. People's homes would no longer be damaged. But there were some problems associated with it as well. No longer are the new silt that had been flooding over the river banks every year not deposited anymore. Remember, that was one thing that made Egypt so agriculturally viable, is that the flooding of the river, in addition to bringing water, also brought all that rich
    00:10:27 nutrient soil on top of the farmland as well, and that has been eliminated. So as a result, people have to use more artificial fertilizers. Well, artificial fertilizers number one are expensive, and number two, they also can cause ecological damage. And we've seen that in this region. It's really affecting the river delta area, the marshy
    00:10:52 area at the mouth of the river where the river meets the Mediterranean. Fishing has declined in the Mediterranean as a result of this dam as well. Also, changes to native species have occurred. One result has been the increase of certain types of disease since the dam was constructed. So it's definitely had its bad points and its good points,
    00:11:13 and whenever humans alter the environment, that's what we find. Sometimes humans do get a benefit from altering the environment, but it's important to note, sometimes there is also negative consequences for the environment, for the ecosystems affected, and the like. So in review, we talked about one way to physically alter
    00:11:33 the environment is to dam rivers. And by damming a river, we can protect against disastrous floods. We do this by creating levees, dams, and embankments. And we talked briefly about how the city of New Orleans has dammed the Mississippi River, and sometimes those embankments and levees can fail, and when that does, it can have catastrophic effects.
    00:11:56 We also talked about channeling water sources. Many people do this in order to increase agricultural land, in order to increase water supplies by building aqueducts and the like. So often we build these type of structures again to move natural bodies of water around a civilization, around a city, and the like. And then finally we talked about ways
    00:12:18 to store water resources. Damming is an effective way to do this. Often when we build dams we have a reservoir behind that dam, a lake that we can use for not only recreational purposes but also to store water in times of drought, or to provide water for a growing civilization. So thank you very much, and I'll see you next time. Bye.

! Section 2

    00:00:00 TEACHER: My name is Kirsten and I'll be your instructor today. This lesson is Altering the Environment. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section we'll be looking at our first objective, to examine techniques that humans have used to physically alter the natural environment. Well our first section, we took a look at the way humans
    00:00:19 alter water sources, specifically rivers. How they divert rivers for agricultural purposes and drinking water, and how we dam rivers to control the flow of rivers to generate electricity, and to form reservoirs to store river water in times of droughts. Well in this section, we're going to take a look at the opposite problem. What happens when we have too much water?
    00:00:40 What happens when we need more land? How do we alter our environment in that way? And the area we're going to take a look at is Mexico City. Now Mexico City is actually built on the ruins of another city, Tenochtitlan, which used to be the capital of the Aztec Empire. And we don't know too much about what it looked like because, unfortunately, so many of the relics from this
    00:01:02 time period were destroyed. But we do know that when the conquistadors came in and saw the city they were completely awed and amazed by what it all entailed. And of course these are people coming from Europe in big cities like Paris, and Madrid in Spain, so it must have been something to behold. Now this particular painting was a mural by the Mexican
    00:01:24 artist Diego Rivera and it gives us an idea about perhaps what the city looked like. We know it had a big temple in the middle and we know that it was formed on an island in the middle of a lake. Many of the islands that were inhabited were actually man-made. The Aztecs would go in, and they would build walls made out of wood, and they would fill those walls in with plant
    00:01:47 matter, and soil, and all kinds of things, and they would use it to grow food. It was an ingenious way to grow food because it was rich in nutrients, but yet also all that river water made sure the plant were irrigated all the time. Now the city of Tenochtitlan was actually founded somewhere about 1325 or 1350. It was the capital of the Aztec Empire, and again, it
    00:02:09 was located on a cluster of islands within a system of lakes. Now in 1521 the city was ravaged by the Spanish conquistadors. Most of the local population was killed. But eventually the Spanish, too, would create another city on top of the ruins. Today Mexico City is the capital of Mexico and one of
    00:02:32 the world's largest cities. And what they did, is again, they built on top of the old city but what they started to do was drain off the water because too often what was happening is the city was flooding. And we're going to take a look at that story in this lesson. So first let's talk about the fact that new land was created.
    00:02:49 And we can see examples of these man-made islands here in this photo. And you can see this man is growing some kind of corn on a man-made island in the middle of this water source. So one way that humans alter the land is by creating artificial islands in order to create more arable land. In Mexico, these are called Chinampas and again, wooden structure or some other structure would be built to
    00:03:18 frame out the island, and then it would be filled in with plant matter, with dirt, and soil, and all kinds of stuff. And once that level reached up the level of the water, then you would have some new land to grow something on. So the Aztecs used it to a farm maize, grains, and herbs. And today, it's often used to farm flowers and other things in Mexico City. Now in addition, another way that people create more arable
    00:03:48 land is by terracing. This is when terraces are cut into the side of hills, almost like steps going up the stairs, and what's great about that is it conserves water because you would water the top and then the water would just run down and be caught in the next level, and then it would run down to be caught in the next level. So no water is wasted, no water just runs off and is not
    00:04:09 used at all. And this is a very effective way to farm in mountainous communities. We see this throughout central America and we see it in very hilly countries like Japan. So let's take a look at land reclamation in Mexico City. So remember, Mexico City is built on the site of a series of lakes.
    00:04:29 And we can see this is a satellite picture of Mexico City today and here's the lakes that used to exist here that are no longer there. So we can really see how it has changed after the fall of the Aztec Empire. Again, the people of Mexico City are going to drain these lakes in order to build more land, which they can build on, and today Mexico City's population is almost 20
    00:04:56 million people. So let's take a look at how they did that. Well one way was to build channels and tunnels to divert the water away from the lake bed to surrounding rivers. One issue that seemed to crop up over, and over, and over in Mexican history was widespread flooding. And a great flood in 1629 submerged the entire city of Mexico City for years.
    00:05:25 And so the people decided that if they wanted to live in this area they had to drain the lakes completely. So again, they constructed this system of canals and tunnels. All the lake water was diverted to nearby rivers and as a result, all this land was now available for settlement and for use. And also the old canals could then be used to transport
    00:05:49 sewage and floodwaters out of the valley. So let's take a look at Mexico City today. One of the issues Mexico City is dealing with, though, is that it's sinking. And we can see two very distinct land levels here in Mexico and even maybe a third one down here in this corner. Many cities that choose this method of land reclamation are facing this issue.
    00:06:13 We see this in the Netherlands. The Netherlands is a country that builds many of its cities on reclaimed land from marshland. And this is happening too in New Orleans. New Orleans, that particular area in the Mississippi River delta was very, very marshy. And so again, swamps are drained and the city's always sinking.
    00:06:32 And that makes protecting from floods even more difficult year after year, after year. And we saw the devastating consequences of that in New Orleans because, of course, New Orleans is located right on the ocean so it's susceptible to floods not only for rains, but also from big hurricanes. Mexico City is in the middle of Mexico so it doesn't have that issue.
    00:06:51 But the land subsidence causes ground levels to drop as much as a foot a year. It's believed that Mexico City has dropped more than 20 feet in the last 100 years because as that ground water gets pumped out, and pumped out, and pumped out everything just packs more and more and more tightly together, and then the land just keep settling, and settling, and settling. Now today Mexico City protects itself from flooding.
    00:07:19 New canals have been constructed to carry flood waters and waste out of the city. But what's interesting is now these drainage systems have to be pumped uphill. That's how much the city has settled. So now all these canals, actually, things get pumped uphill into those rivers. And this is going to be a continuing
    00:07:37 problem in Mexico City. How much more can it possibly sink? And secondly, Mexico City's running into water scarcity issues, which is amazing considering it used to be built on this lake bed. But because its population is growing so quickly, that is a new concern that Mexico City is facing. OK.
    00:07:55 So in this section we took a look at another way that humans alter their environment. Ways to get more land. How do we create more land when there isn't enough for agriculture? So the Aztecs, we talked about how they created these Chinampas, these man-made islands in order to grow more food.
    00:08:13 We also talked about terracing on the side of mountains in order to have more arable land. Mexico City has undergone a many, many century process of reclaiming more land for inhabitation. They drained the lakes there in the central valley of Mexico. And of course this had a benefit of creating more land, however it's also very dangerous.
    00:08:35 We see Mexico City is sinking more, and more, and more every year. And as a result, it's going to be more susceptible to rainfall flooding and other types of flooding as a result. And people wonder how much more can we possibly sink. And there's another concern also, running out of fresh water for drinking purposes. So thank you very much and I'll see you next time.
    00:08:57 Bye.

! Section 3

    00:00:01 TEACHER: Hi, my name is Kirstin and I'm your instructor today. This lesson is Altering the Environment. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here and in this section we'll be looking at the second objective, to analyze technologies humans have developed to survive and thrive in environments. Well humans have proven themselves to be very, very resilient in living in some of the most extreme environments
    00:00:23 on the planet Earth. This has been going on for centuries and luckily technological innovations has made this process even easier today. In this section we're going to be looking at Dubai, a city located in the Middle East, where temperatures in the summer can reach in excess of 110 degrees. What kind of changes have they had to make to their
    00:00:43 environment, how do they survive in the desert, how do they get enough water in an area that is starved for fresh water, and how do people live such a sophisticated life. So this section is all about the city of Dubai. Now Dubai is a city located in the United Arab Emirates. It's located on the Persian Gulf and it's a country that is seven states. Each of the states has an Emir and then they also elect an
    00:01:14 Emir to be the head of the government of the entire country. Now in the 1960's oil resources were discovered, and so the population began to grow very rapidly as exploitation of these resources began. The city has grown to a population in excess of one million people, and it is an incredible achievement in design and architecture.
    00:01:39 The Emirs of the United Arab Emirates were determined to make this a very beautiful capital city. They have very wonderful architecture. Some of the world's tallest buildings are located here, some of the most fabulous hotels, and it's a very interesting look at when there's plenty of income, and there's a true desire to make something wonderful, what can be achieved.
    00:02:01 In 2010 the world's largest freestanding building was constructed, the Burj Khalifa. And this is actually named Khalifa after one of the Emirates who helped the City of Dubai, in the country of the United Arab Emirates, when their economy started to struggle in the last previous years. He made a huge donation to the United Arab Emirates, and so in honor of him they renamed the building after him.
    00:02:30 Another interesting thing that they have done that we're going to take a look at later in this section, is the creation of artificial island complexes that jut out into the Persian Gulf that provide new land. Beautiful hotels are constructed on these islands, beautiful homes, and we're going to take a look at how they've done that a little bit later in the lesson. OK, Dubai has a very, very warm and dry climate.
    00:02:53 Their average temperature year round is over 90 degrees and again, in the summer, it gets well over 110, scarce water resources, and an average of only four to six inches of rain annually. So making sure that there's enough fresh water is one of the biggest challenges in addition to dealing with this extreme heat. So how does Dubai do it?
    00:03:13 Well first, obviously, air conditioning is very important. But we know air conditioning can be very, very expensive. On the left we have a picture of an indoor ski resort in Dubai. So again, it's a bit of a playground for the wealthy around the world. One way they cope with cooling is evaporative cooling.
    00:03:35 Now this is a very interesting affect. Perhaps you've ever been swimming in a swimming pool and there's a mister attached to it that sprays water out in fine droplets. Well that's one way that you can keep the temperature of pool water down in very, very hot climates. So in desert climates like in Arizona and Las Vegas, pools often have those misters attached, because as water
    00:03:55 evaporates, it also cools. And in ancient times in ancient Egypt, people would place wet mats in front of their doorways and windows and as the air blew through again, it would cause that evaporation effect, cooling down the air. Now, of course, today we use air conditioning. But air conditioning hasn't been around very long. Only since the 1930's was air conditioning applied in homes
    00:04:20 and, of course, now today we have air conditioning in all kinds of places where humans congregate, in subway trains, and cars, and homes, and in shopping complexes. In addition, Dubai must regulate temperature and humidity in all of their office complexes and the like. This enables us to survive in harsh climates and enables us to transport products safely from place to place. A very important invention was refrigerated train cars,
    00:04:49 refrigerated trucks, because this allowed us to ship foods over long distances without spoiling. However it does contribute to high energy usage. The average amount of electricity used by a person in Dubai is actually twice as much as used by a person in the United States because of the demand for air conditioning virtually year round. Next, another issue that Dubai is faced with is fresh water.
    00:05:15 There simply is very little fresh water and as their population has grown they've had to find more creative ways to ensure that there's enough water to drink, enough water for agriculture, and the like. So one increasing method that people are starting to turn to is desalination. So this is the process of turning seawater into drinkable water, drinkable fresh water, water that can be
    00:05:40 used for other purposes as well. Because you can't drink seawater, obviously. Eventually you will die as it causes your body to dehydrate. You can't use seawater for animals for drinking. You can't use it on crops, either. And so desalination is the process that we turn seawater into usable water for the purposes of drinking, for
    00:06:02 bathing, for showering, for watering crops, and the like. Now there are a couple of methods that desalination plants use. One is called reverse osmosis. And basically what happens is, you have a semi-permeable membrane and you use pressure to push water through that membrane and smaller molecules, the water actually presses through while anything
    00:06:24 dissolved in the water stays on the other side of the membrane. That would be the salt and other minerals. That's one way that they desalinate water. Another way is through heating and filtering, or distillation. If you boil water and then catch the steam and let it condense, of course, that boiled water would then be
    00:06:43 free of contaminants, free of salt, and other ways. So those are the two most common methods that are used. Now this is a very, very expensive process. It's very, very costly. It uses a great deal of energy so as a result, many countries have been reluctant to turn to it, because it is so expensive. Secondly, of course,
    00:07:07 environmentalists are concerned. Well, we can't just simply turn to the ocean and use ocean water because that's going to affect the ocean environment as well. Now many of these plants, of course, require significant amounts of energy to operate, but again, as more desalination plants are built, as we improve technology, the costs will then probably go down, and this might be more
    00:07:30 affordable for countries. As of right now only developed countries can afford this technology. We see this desalination used in the Middle East, we see it in Israel, we see it in countries like Spain, but it's not affordable for other countries, those in the developing world, that don't have this kind of income. OK, so let's take a look at desalination in Dubai.
    00:07:54 It's a significant source of water for the people of Dubai. Almost all fresh water that is used in the United Arab Emirates comes from desalination plants. Wells and regular sources of fresh water can only meet a very small percentage of demand. Again, their water resources are very limited and they do have this growing population. In 2009 nearly 400 million gallons of water were produced
    00:08:18 each day in Dubai by desalination plants. And again, this accounts for more than 90 percent of Dubai's freshwater production. So in review, if you're going to survive and make it in a tough, tough environmental climate, you have to be very adaptable. And one area where this has occurred is in the United Arab Emirates.
    00:08:41 They have adapted air conditioning climate controls in their environment in order to live in harsh conditions. So in most very, very hot climates in the developed world you're going to find just about every building's going to be air conditioned, every home will be air conditioned, every car would be air conditioned, just because temperatures simply get too hot for people to survive without it.
    00:09:06 In order for this to occur, of course, this requires development of extensive power generation as well as other infrastructure to make sure that electricity can be delivered to the people of the region. Secondly, in an area with very low natural freshwater resources, desalination has proven to be an option to provide communities with more fresh water. This is an industrial process that turns sea water into
    00:09:35 fresh water but it's very, very expensive which prohibits it's use in many parts of the world. Well take a look at this picture. This is another picture from Dubai. This is the Palm Jumeirah. This is an extensive complex of resorts and homes. You can see man-made islands there in the shape of a palm tree jut out into the ocean.
    00:10:00 On each of those palm fronds you have beautiful, beautiful houses and apartment buildings. You have dozens of hotels and fabulous restaurants and places for people to socialize, go on vacation, have a wonderful time. So this is really a very impressive way that humans have modified their environment. You can see it's very, very beautiful.
    00:10:23 We have the hotels here on the right, gorgeous to look at, water's provided, electricity is provided, extra land is provided, and it shows you what humans can do with enough money, and enough will, and enough vision. So it's very, very impressive. So what I'd like you to think about is how has your community altered your environment? Do you have dams nearby?
    00:10:47 Do have a reservoir? How many roads do you have? What has your community done to make your area more livable, more habitable, than it would have been without those changes? And what changes do you think we can expect to see in the future? What's does the future have in store for human beings when it
    00:11:05 comes to altering our environment? What changes do you think we're going to have to make to our environment as our population continues to grow? It's expected we'll have somewhere in the neighborhood of nine billion people on earth by 2050. What do you think 100 years from now, when we have even more people on earth, how will we have to change our environment?
    00:11:22 How can we make sure we have enough arable land? How can we make sure we have enough water? What changes do you expect to see in the future? So thank you very much, and I'll see you next time. Bye
