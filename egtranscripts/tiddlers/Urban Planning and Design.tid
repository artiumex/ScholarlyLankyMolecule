title: Urban Planning and Design
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

! Section 1
00:00:01
TEACHER: Hi. My name is Kirstin, and I'll be your instructor today. Well, if someone asked you to design the perfect city from the ground up, what would it look like? What kind of spaces would you set aside for parks, recreation, or for housing or buildings? What type of architecture would you choose to use? And what would your city look like overall?
00:00:21
Well, city planners make those kinds of decisions all the time. If a developer comes to them and they want a new neighborhood to be constructed, the city planner has to decide if that's a good idea. Will that neighborhood have enough access to water, or police or fire protection? What type of roads will we have to build in order to make
00:00:38
sure that people who live in the new neighborhood will be able to reach their jobs or schools or even shopping destinations? In this lesson, we're going to learn about urban planning, the decisions that city planners make every day about where to locate services and resources. And we're going to take a look at some of the more famous designs and theories proposed by city planners.
00:01:01
This lesson is titled Urban Planning and Design. Our objectives. To explore various theories of urban construction and development. To analyze the relationship between the built environment and the natural environment. And to compare and contrast planned cities to those that develop organically.
00:01:20
In this lesson, we'll be looking at the first objective. And as we go along, some of our words and terms will be highlighted in purple. Pay close attention to them, because they're part of your vocabulary for this lesson. OK. So let's take a look where cities are located.
00:01:35
So when we look at the big map to see where cities are located across a state or across a country, what we find is that often they're located in central places. This is Walter Christaller's Central Place Theory. And it basically says that small cities don't need the same things that big cities do. Smaller cities, smaller towns, have facilities that meet urgent daily needs, so things like schools, and police
00:02:02
protection, supermarkets, and stores that provide basic services. But they certainly don't necessarily need the diversity in services and facilities that larger cities do. Larger cities have things that aren't needed everywhere, things like sports stadiums. Chances are your small town, if you live in one, doesn't have a professional sports team, although there's a couple of exceptions to that
00:02:27
particular rule. We don't need lots and lots of theaters that show plays, for example. We don't necessarily need high end department stores in a small town that would bring a great deal of appeal maybe in a bigger city. Secondly, we notice that larger cities are located in central locations.
00:02:45
That way, small cities still have access to the services in a large city, but they don't need them every day, so they can travel to the larger city in order to get the services that they want or need. Next let's take a look at the way cities develop. Well, cities typically don't develop just haphazardly. They typically develop in certain ways, with different parts of a city dedicated to different types of facilities
00:03:10
and activities. First, there's usually a Central Business District. This is often called the downtown area. And you might find business headquarters here, large arts and entertainment complexes, and so forth. Then we have residential districts, where home and living spaces are developed, as well as commercial districts, where sales and service spaces are developed.
00:03:34
And what often happens is these two parts of a city intermingle. So they develop close together. They might be interspaced. So there might be a residential district, and then a commercial district, and then another residential district in smaller areas. Then finally, we have industrial districts.
00:03:51
These are spaces to manufacture and trade. Airports, huge factories, ports, and the like. So next we're going to take a look at how cities grow. And there are three models that we're going to take a look at, the Burgess model, the Hoyt model, and the Multiple Nuclei model. Now this does not mean that there's only one right answer here.
00:04:14
It's not like one of these models is correct and the other two are wrong. Instead, we see evidence of this type of city growth in all three models around the globe. So the Burgess model was created in 1929. And it says that cities grow in rings. The Hoyt model, in 1939, which says cities grow likes spokes on a wheel.
00:04:34
And then finally, the Multiple Nuclei model, which was developed in 1945, that says cities grow like cells. So we're talking like cells in the body, cells in plants and the like. And again, it's important to note that there's plenty of examples of all three of these models that exist. So first let's take a look at the Burgess model. This is the concentric ring theory of urban land use.
00:04:58
So basically, this was developed by sociologist Ernest Burgess in 1926. And he says that cities grow like trees do. And if you ever have seen a tree stump, or you've cut a tree in half, you can see that trees grow in rings, and for every year of life there's another ring. And basically Burgess said that cities grow the same way, that the city starts off in the middle, that's where the
00:05:23
downtown area or Central Business District is. And everything grows from outside of that particular central area. This model predicts that industrial areas will surround the CBD, or downtown. And again, CBD is Central Business District. That residential and commercial areas will become wealthier as they get further away from downtown, and that
00:05:46
wealthier residents can afford to live further from the city. So let's take a look at this model here. And we can see, here's the Central Business District. So this is our downtown area. And then around that we have factories and industry. And factories and industry are located close to the downtown area, because that's where typically the business headquarters are located.
00:06:07
And the factory will be located slightly out of that central area. Next we have the low class residential. That's because poor people have to live close to the factories. That's less desirable, because often there's pollution or it's dirty or nasty and the like. And then the further away we get from that industrial area,
00:06:27
the more expensive homes and areas become. So finally the suburbs, the high class residential, is furthest away from the Central Business District, because people can afford to drive into the city every day. People can afford to take the train in every day. And again, they can have more space, nicer housing, if they're further away. Now the next model is the Hoyt model.
00:06:48
And this is sometimes called the Sector Theory of Urban Land Use. And again, this is the one that looked like spokes. This is developed by the economist Homer Hoyt, in 1939. Now under this model, it says that cities will grow outward along transportation routes, and that low income residential areas will surround industrial areas in a city.
00:07:08
So it's similar that way to the previous model, the Burgess model, in that the worst kind of housing is in the industrial areas. So let's take a look at this particular model here. And we can see that these are our transportation routes. So they might be rail lines. They might be freeways, depending upon the time period that we're looking at.
00:07:28
But basically, it says, this is how our city is going to develop, along these transportation routes. So let's take a look here. So in the middle, we still have that Central Business District. So this is our downtown area. Then we have factories and industry that develop along two of our transportation routes.
00:07:45
So they might develop along a rail line. And that makes sense, because as products are created, they have to be shipped out. So we could put them on a train or along a highway and we could put them on trucks to truck them out. And then, of course, we know that's not the nicest area of town. There's a lot of industry and factories.
00:08:00
So this is going to be the area with our least desirable housing. And then we have middle class and high class residential, or our suburbs. And this time our suburbs have the advantage of being closest to the transportation routes. So again, the residents that live closer to the interstate, for example, those neighborhoods are going to be
00:08:21
a little bit nicer than people that have to fight the traffic to get on the interstate. So again the high class residential develops along one line. And again, it's surrounded by middle class residential, Next let's take a look at the Multiple Nuclei model. So again, this is the one that kind of looks like the way animal cells or plant cells grow.
00:08:40
This is the nucleus theory of urban land use, developed by geographers Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman, in 1945. Now, it predicts that cities no longer need just one downtown, that cities don't develop that way. Instead, cities develop several Central Business Districts. And again, we don't need just one downtown, because people have cars today.
00:09:02
That gives people more flexibility to live other places. Cities don't have to follow strict patterns of growth anymore. They can become clusters that surround multiples CBDs, or Central Business Districts. So let's take a look at this. So instead of just having one Central Business District,
00:09:20
instead we have several. And our city is going to develop around these several business districts. So one might still be a big downtown area, but maybe one's a big hospital complex. And if you've ever visited a big city, sometimes there's like all kinds of hospitals together that specialize in different things.
00:09:36
There might be a big hospital, a children's hospital, a research hospital. Another business district might be a high tech area and it specializes in computers and IT technology and programming and the like. And then what happens is the factories and industry are going to be located near some of the business districts. And of course, again, low class residential, again, no
00:10:01
one wants to live close to factories, so typically these are going to be are less expensive housing. But then we're going to have middle class and high class suburbs as well. And sometimes even maybe one of our Central Business Districts, we're going to have perhaps like a city hall there, a suburb's city hall. We're going to have important services, or maybe another
00:10:22
type of company's headquarters there. So again maybe they administer over the suburb areas as well. OK. So in review, we took a look at where cities are located. And typically, they're located in central places. This was Christaller's Central Place Theory. And again, he said that small cities have different needs than big cities do.
00:10:44
And sometimes big cities have some facilities that we don't typically find in a smaller city. Then we looked at three models of city growth. First in rings, which is the Concentric Zone Theory. Next in sectors, which is Hoyt's sector model, where the city grows along transportation routes. And finally, in cells. That's the Multiple Nuclei model.
00:11:03
Well, thank you very much. And I'll see you next time. Bye.

! Section 2
00:00:02
TEACHER: Hi. Welcome back. This lesson is Urban Planning and Design. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here. And in this section, we'll be looking at our second objective, to analyze the relationship between the built environment and the natural environment. Well, in any city, we have two environments.
00:00:18
First, we have the built environment. This includes anything built by humans, from buildings and skyscrapers to houses and streets, as well as parks and anything else constructed by people. The other thing it includes are any of the choices or decisions that people make about the environment around them, where to place things and so forth. The other half of the cityscape is the natural
00:00:40
environment. This includes the climate. It includes native animal and plant life and natural spaces, as well as any physical features, like mountains, rivers, lakes, and so forth. Now of course, these two environment affect each other as well as the choices that people make about where to put things, where to build things and construct things.
00:01:00
So first, let's take a look at how the natural environment affects the decisions that people make about the built environment. So first, let's talk about water, land, and planning. Now water and land, of course, influence a city's structures. Dangers encourage people to build safely. A great example would be New Orleans, Louisiana. This particular city is especially prone to flooding
00:01:22
from tropical storms. It's built near the mouth of the Mississippi River. And it's also built on land that is slowly sinking. As a result, the city has hundreds of levees, dams, and water channels to protect the city from flooding. Now, of course, we know despite people's best efforts, nature can be very, very powerful. And during Hurricane Katrina, many of those levees failed,
00:01:45
and the city flooded anyway. But again, those preparations that people make also affect the environment around them. It's affected the flow of the river. it's also affected the level that the river rises to whenever it travels through that particular city. Now physical features of the natural environment can force a city to build very, very carefully.
00:02:07
And you only have to think about earthquakes and so forth to imagine the types of ramifications that those hazards place on the way people build things. Climate, of course, is another factor that can affect city structures. Built environments are created to cope with the extreme temperatures in climate. For example, in the city of Dubai, it gets very, very hot,
00:02:28
so summer temperatures, when they reach 100 degrees, many businesses are built inside with air conditioning, in order to account for that particular climate. The opposite is true in a city like Montreal. Montreal gets very, very cold in winter, below 20 degrees. And so there are many underground spaces, underground walking spaces from building to building, in order for people to remain warm.
00:02:53
Now in this section, we're going to take a look at how the built environment, of course, affects the natural environment. So of course, this relationship goes both ways. So first, let's take a look at the land. This is Tokyo Harbor. And you can see some islands in this harbor. But they don't look natural.
00:03:11
You can see they're very square or rectangular in nature. That's because these are man-made islands. So one way that humans alter the land is by physically shaping it. This can include landscaping or tunnels or terracing the side of mountains in order to farm or build homes. Tokyo Bay, again, is a great example.
00:03:32
They created new lands for a growing city. The airport itself is constructed on one of these man-made islands. This construction began during the 1800s and continued through the 1900s as well. In the beginning, these islands were created for fortification, to protect the city from invaders. But of course, today, Tokyo is a rapidly growing city, so the
00:03:52
islands have helped create new land for people to live and work on. Next, we have climate. And we can see here this very, very dry desert area. Human structures also can influence climate. And a great example is the need for water. Of course, water is important for people to drink. It's important for agriculture.
00:04:13
And all throughout the world, people have been altering the natural course of water to bring it where the people are in order to use it for these types of purposes. So an example would be in the city of Los Angeles, as it began to grow, the need for water became a serious concern. So water was diverted from the Owens River by the creation of aqueducts.
00:04:35
These are like man-made, huge channels that can carry water over long distances. They carried lots of water away from the Owens River. And eventually, Owens Lake dried up because it wasn't receiving enough water to remain a lake. So this is a great example about how man-made decisions can affect a natural environment. Owens Lake used to be a thriving lake with plant and
00:04:57
animal life, and now, it's a dry, barren place. And we can see that in that photo. It experiences destructive dust storms. Finally, another way that human choices can affect the environment is the invasion of species and how they affect native species. The creation of harbors, the creation of man-made lakes, sometimes we get little organisms and critters in that
00:05:24
don't belong in that natural habitat. And this problem has escalated as transportation times have decreased. So we think about ships that go all around the world and aircraft. They're carrying goods, but they're also carrying insects and all kinds of other things and introducing those into native environments.
00:05:41
And a big problem has been the zebra and quagga mussels in the Great Lakes. These particular species have invaded. And they've kind of taken over. And this has resulted in the destruction of some native fish species and plant species because these other species don't have natural predators. And they have taken over the habitat.
00:06:02
They've been brought in by shipping to Great Lakes harbors, and this is a problem that has spread throughout the United States. So in review, we talked about nature's influence on the built environment. Land and water can influence where cities are built. And of course, some of the hazards associated with water can affect the way cities are constructed.
00:06:20
And we looked at the way that New Orleans was constructed. Climate, of course, also influences city spaces. Places with really, really hot climates, you don't necessarily want outdoor malls. You want air-conditioned spaces. Now humans' building locations, human decisions for aqueducts and so forth can also affect natural environments.
00:06:41
We talked about how in Tokyo, they've altered the landform to create more land. We talked about changing water sources, bringing that water into Los Angeles, how that resulted in the destruction of Owens Lake, and then finally, the impact of native species. So hang on. We're going to take a little break. And when we get back, we're going to talk about ways that
00:07:00
planners plan out cities and things they do to make cities more attractive and beautiful for their residents. So hang on, and I'll see you in just a minute.

! Section 3
00:00:02
TEACHER: Hi. Welcome back. This lesson is Urban Planning and Design. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here. And in this section, we'll be looking at our third objective, to compare and contrast planned cities to those that develop organically. So first, let's take a look at a model for a planned city.
00:00:18
This is a grid city. And we can see why it's called a grid. The streets basically run two directions, perhaps north and south and east and west. And they meet at right angles. And we can see that some thought has been put into this plan, where are we going to put streets and so forth. This is not a city that's just been allowed to grow however it wants as time goes on.
00:00:41
Now early planned cities often followed this model. It's the most common model that we see here in the United States. It provides for an ease of navigation from point A to point B. The streets are aligned either to coordinate systems or perhaps the cardinal directions. It's also quicker for transportation routes to be established.
00:01:00
And it's easy to determine what spaces are going to be used for. We can set aside one of these squares for a park. We can set up so many squares for housing. Clear divisions exist between plots of land. And these cities have been around for a very, very long time. One of the oldest grid cities was designed by
00:01:21
Hippodamus of Greece. He was an architect and early city planner. And he believed that grid designs promote balance within a city, that this would allow for separate spaces for living and working and worshipping and recreation, as well as participating in government. He believed that carefully planned resources and spaces led to more balanced lives, and that orderly spaces
00:01:44
encourage orderly behavior. Now one movement that played on the grid system was the City Beautiful. And we can see in this photo the kind of elements that we're talking about with this particular architectural movement, lots of green spaces, lots of trees, the use of water, as well, again, as that general grid system. Now, this one's slightly different because the grids
00:02:08
are on angles. But we still see clear planning and thought going into it. Now the City Beautiful movement began in the early 1900s. And people believed that by planning a beautiful city, it would lead to a happier life for its citizens. And you have to think about what's going on during this
00:02:25
time period in America. We have the Industrial Revolution. People are working really hard six days a week. But when they get off work, they want to be done. And they want recreation. And they want to enjoy their weekends. And so by having a beautiful city, people felt that people would lead a happier life.
00:02:44
And they needed parks for recreation and so forth because again, during this timeframe, cities are growing very, very fast. People are crammed in really tight together. So we need spaces for people to get around. Now the City Beautiful movement began with an architect named Daniel Hudson Burnham. And he was the lead designer for the 1893
00:03:05
Chicago World's Fair. They took a space apart from the city where they were going to have the fair, several hundred acres. And he designed a beautiful layout inspired by Greek and Roman architecture, with water and trees and plants. And people were awed. They called it the White City because all the buildings were white, and the sun just reflected off of them.
00:03:28
And this really began a movement throughout America to make cities more attractive. And this can be seen very clearly in many of our cities today. So let's look at the principles of the City Beautiful movement. First, grid planning and organized streets, which inspires, again, orderliness in behavior and building.
00:03:47
Open and green park spaces, this invites people to get out, to enjoy recreation for better health. Classical Greek and Roman architecture, like the columns that you see on this museum here. This creates a sense of awe in citizens and an awe in their own historical roots. Because again, here in America, we do, our government, for example, has those clear Roman and Greek
00:04:13
roots in it. As well as memorials and artistic spaces. Here is a photo from the Lincoln memorial, which inspires respect for the city and its past. So a great example of the City Beautiful movement is Washington, DC. Now Washington, DC, of course, had been planned in the 1700s. But that plan had not been fully realized.
00:04:35
It wasn't until the early 1900s, they began to decide that America was growing in prominence, the capital needed to grow in prominence, and what plan they were going to use to do that. So again, we can see those elements, the Capitol Building, for example, clear Roman and Greek inspiration, the big, open spaces, the wide streets and boulevards, as well as the various memorials.
00:04:58
So Washington, DC, was designed according to a master plan by Pierre L'Enfant in 1791. Again, he developed that plan. But it was not fully realized in the 1700s. It wasn't until 1901, when Senator James McMillan led a committee to determine how they were going to improve the capital. They pulled out that old plan.
00:05:18
They revised it some. And again, they used those City Beautiful principles. There are many famous monuments and memorials, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and so forth. Green spaces for recreation, that big National Mall area, for example. And they also created the buildings for the Smithsonian
00:05:36
Institute and places of learning. So let's take a look at the other side. So what happens when there is no city planning? We do see this occasionally. Organic growth occurs when cities grow very, very quickly, unplanned, fast. So it can happen when a city springs up because of a new economic resource, and it grows very, very quickly in
00:05:59
response to immediate supply and demand. We also see this, typically, in cities that are very, very old, long before there are cars and railroads and so forth. These cities typically have unpredictable road patterns and city layouts. And a great example of an organic city is London. And here, we see no grid system.
00:06:20
We see a hodgepodge of roads in all directions. And you can imagine how difficult it is to get around a city like this. Very difficult to navigate if you're unfamiliar with the city. On top of that, city streets tend to be very narrow, pathways tend to be narrow, again, because buildings have been around for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
00:06:40
years, well before cars and technology like we have here in America, where cities are much newer, to accommodate for those types of things. So take a look. Here's one of the most important streets in London. We can see it curves and kind of goes off in all kinds of directions, very, very different from a city that was planned from day one.
00:07:00
This is the city of Phoenix. Very, very common to find these types of layouts in the West. Very, very strict grid systems, you can see lots of thought has been planned out. We see how far those streets extend, well beyond where people are living. And again, they're thinking about the future. So in review, we talked about the fact that cities may grow
00:07:20
either according to a plan or according to immediate demands, and that's called organically. Planned cities, the grid city is one example, that's the most common form that we see here in the United States. And again, the City Beautiful was a movement to improve that layout. Organic cities tend to grow according to needs, rather than principles.
00:07:38
We see this in cities that spring up very quickly overnight and grow too fast for any planning to be done, or in cities that are very, very old, that have been around hundreds of years, before modern transportation and the like. So in this lesson, we've learned about city planning and ways that our leaders have made decisions about where to put buildings, where to put green park spaces, where to
00:08:01
put airports and the like, and ways they have made adjustments in order to make our cities more attractive. So I'd like you to think about if you had to create a new city, which type of plan would you go for? Would you be interested in a grid city, perhaps the City Beautiful principles? Or would you want your city to grow more organically? And I'd like you to think about where you live, and
00:08:22
which of those principles do you think the city where you live applies most. So thanks so much, and I'll see you next time. Bye.
