    00:00:01 PROFESSOR: Hi, I'm Jane, your instructor. Can the internet save your life? Well, it did for Chinese girl in 1995, who lay dying from a mysterious illness in a Beijing hospital. Despite their best efforts, none of her doctors could figure out what was wrong with her. Desperate to save her life, one of her friends posted her condition on an internet message board, and an American
    00:00:21 doctor read it, shared the information with his colleagues, and in just a few hours around the world, doctors were discussing her case. They came up with a diagnosis: thallium poisoning. The girl received the appropriate treatment and medication and was healed. The happy ending would not have been possible just a few years earlier.
    00:00:43 It illustrates the growing cooperation and dependence that people around the world share. It also shows just how fast communications have become. Doctors around the world were consulted in a matter of moments, something that would have taken days or even weeks to accomplish just a few years earlier. In this lesson, we'll be learning about the ways people around the world depend on each other and how the
    00:01:04 internet and information superhighway have changed our lives. This lesson is International Interdependence. Our objectives are to explain the role of resources on economic interdependence, discuss the role of technology and how it has impacted trade and communication, evaluate the pros and cons of globalization. And in this section, we're going to focus
    00:01:24 on the first one. You may notice some terms are in bold and in blue. Pay close attention to those because they are your vocabulary words. What is economic interdependence? Well, for example, a farm, a family farm, might be able to produce dairy products or eggs, fruits and vegetables, field crops, and maybe some meat.
    00:01:44 But they can't produce everything that they need or want. They don't produce the farm equipment, the shoes and clothing, the utilities, the appliances that they need, the entertainment, services, or other foods. These they have to get from someone else, some other company, some other store somewhere. Economic interdependence then is that each person is
    00:02:04 dependent upon others for certain things. Countries must specialize in what they can produce affordably, so the US produces some agricultural products, like meat, cotton, corn, beef, and chicken. Now, countries trade for other items. They trade for anything that's too expensive to produce to get everything that people need. So they trade in order to fulfill all the needs and the
    00:02:29 wants of their citizens. Countries trade for items that can be produced cheaper elsewhere. For example, the US imports household goods such as clothing furniture and appliances. These things can be made more cheaply or less expensively in factories in other countries, and then those items can be sold in the United States.
    00:02:50 Countries trade for items that they can't produce due to a lack of resources. For example, the US has to import oil to meet the demand of all the US citizens in a case where you can't produce enough to meet demand. Let's take a look at this global map of economic interdependence. North America produces agriculture products,
    00:03:11 aircraft, computer components. Latin America is well known for fruits and vegetables and coffee. Europe, machinery, automobiles, and pharmaceuticals. The Middle East and North Africa produces oil. Sub-Saharan Africa has gold, minerals, and diamonds. Japan, transport equipment and electronics, and China,
    00:03:30 manufacturing consumer goods. All these countries produce all these different things, and each one relies on the other. In order to get the different goods and services that they need, they must trade. So it creates a web, a global web of economic interdependence, where all the countries are trading with one another to get everything that their citizens need and want.
    00:03:55 Polynesia is a great example of this. About 2,000 years ago, the people of Polynesia, the Polynesian people, spread out among these various islands in the Pacific. Now, the key to survival became long-distance trade. You saw on that map how far apart these islands were. Each island had different resources, and they couldn't produce all that they needed.
    00:04:20 So some islands had volcanic stones that you could use to make certain stone tools or certain cooking stones. Other islands had ways of using coral and such to fashion into fish hooks, or other types of luxuries, like foods such as coconuts and bananas and things like that. So what would happen is you would find each of these things on islands where they could have been made, that they weren't native to, because of long distance trade
    00:04:54 among the islands. Famines were common and societies would have collapsed or went extinct if trade was disrupted. Trade is still vital to the survival of the people of Polynesia today. They export tropical fruits, spices, vanilla, cocoa beans, and sugar. And they import things like meat and manufactured items
    00:05:13 such as shoes and clothing, canned goods, dairy products, soap, and tobacco. So without trade, you can't meet all the needs and the wants of the people. And it's very vital for the people of Polynesia because they're living on such small islands that are in some cases remote and don't have all of the resources in order to make everything that people need and want, so trade becomes
    00:05:37 very important. Just to review this section, countries cannot produce all that they need to survive. Economic interdependence is when each person is dependent upon others for certain things. This results in specialization. One example is Polynesia, where you have certain islands in Polynesia producing things that is easy for them to make
    00:05:59 due to the fact that they have the resources available to them, and then they trade with others for the things that they're missing. Thanks so much for joining me, and I look forward to seeing you in our next section, where we continue talking about economic interdependence around the world.

! Section 2

    00:00:00 PROFESSOR: Hi. I'm Jane, your instructor. Welcome back to our discussion on international interdependence. This is section two. Our objective for this section, to discuss the role of technology and how it has impacted trade and communication.
    00:00:12 Remember, you may notice some terms are in bold and in blue. Pay close attention to those, because they're your vocabulary terms. The impact of technology has really created advancements in transportation, starting with improvements in road, leading to early ocean transportation, and resulting in modern transportation systems. The same is true of technology and the influence on communication.
    00:00:35 We have first communication by land and sea, then the telegraph and the telephone, and ultimately leading to our modern communication systems today. Transportation costs. Historically, transportation costs have declined over time. If you look back as far as the Silk Road, which was the most important trade route for over 4,000 years, it was very expensive.
    00:01:00 We were trading over long distances from China to Europe things like silk, gold, precious stones and textiles, ceramics. It took years for goods to be transported between China and Europe, because it was going over road, so it took a great deal of time. Early ocean trade, the cost declines, but it was still expensive.
    00:01:23 And one way to consider what the cost might have been is for many colonists who didn't have enough money. They wanted to come from Europe to the American colonies. They often would come as indentured servants, which meant that they would work for someone else, do labor for someone else for a fixed amount of time as a way to repay them for their ticket on the boat.
    00:01:45 Well, they typically would work about seven years just to pay off the cost of their ticket. So you can see that travel over the ocean in early ocean trade was still pretty expensive. It can take you a few months to get where you were going rather than a few years, so it did improve in terms of speed. But modern transportation can be done via rail, sea, trucks, as well as aircraft.
    00:02:12 The cost is relatively inexpensive, because more goods are being carried at once. So lots of different goods are being placed on, which is lowering the overall transport cost. It can take a few days or a few hours to get something where you need it to go. The result is a dramatic increase in global trade, because as the time increases in which you can get something
    00:02:39 done, so it's a lot quicker to get something. But the price has decreased, so you can do it relatively inexpensively and in a relatively quick amount of time compared overall. You still do have to pay for things, and if you want to-- for example, if you were sending something and you had a choice of sending it standard delivery, whereas it might go over roads, or you want it to be overnighted,
    00:03:02 where it would fly to your destination and then be put on a mail truck or some type of carrier's truck and delivered, you're going to probably pay more for it to go faster. And that's going to be expensive for you, but if we're comparing it over time, these costs have declined greatly. Modern transportation, well, we're actually looking at an image of a specially designed crane for these containers.
    00:03:29 And you can see containers sitting on a rail line. These are intermodal containers. Their freight transport revolutionized modern shipping. You've probably seen these before if you're on a highway. A tractor-trailer truck will pull something like this. These can go from a tractor-trailer truck, be taken to a train yard, where it can be then put on a train
    00:03:56 for delivery. And then it can also then go from there onto a ship. These are containers that are used for different modes of transportation. That's why they're called intermodal. They're used globally, and there's a global standard for size so that they can go from one country to another and be put onto a different form of transport.
    00:04:18 So you might see them on the road, on the sea, or on a rail car. These were introduced in 1956, and they utilize multiple methods of transport-- ships, rail cars, and trucks. These reduced costs and increased the transport of goods. Their specially designed cranes make it easy to move
    00:04:40 the containers on and off ships and rail cars and trucks, because these cranes can pick them up and move them from one type of transport to the other. Information technology and communications. Well, in the beginning, everything was carried by hand. The technology maybe discovered in China might not make its way to Europe for decades.
    00:05:02 And other ideas spread, but it had to spread by direct contact between people, and it took a long time. The increase in ocean-going vessels in the 1400s increased communication speeds, but it sometimes took months to get a message around. So at first, ideas, invention, and technology are all carried by hand. Now, the early telegraph and telephone and really--
    00:05:27 these are in the 1800s-- these are really the beginning of telecommunications. The time reduced. Electricity is used to increase the speed of communication. But just one thing in terms of that telegraph. It's still relatively slow, and it can take some time. And a great example is the Battle of New Orleans.
    00:05:44 It's a pivotal battle of the War of 1812 between Britain and the US. Now, that battle was fought for two weeks after the peace treaty was signed in Belgium and the war was effectively over. It took about two weeks to get that information to the soldiers on the battlefield. Now, modern communication and IT systems, this really
    00:06:04 introduced computer technology and the internet. We see first the transatlantic radio transmission happened in 1902, and then from there, it really just builds on-- transmission of time's reduced in minutes to seconds to fractions of a second. The first computer technology is really introduced in the 1940s, transistors and integrated circuits in the 1960s, CPUs and microprocessors in the 1980s,
    00:06:36 and the internet in the 1990s. And we see that there's-- we see that there's that computer technology, but they really started to take off-- in the '70s they're starting to design for that personal computer, which really hits it big in the '80s and the '90s. And of course today, you're just using one right now just to view this lecture.
    00:06:57 The costs continue to decline because of the increased use and competition. So over time, you know that there're many different types of computers being made by different companies. The same can be said for cell phones, which have many different makers, and is driving the cost down. Or at least cell phones were very expensive. Now today they're much cheaper, although smartphones
    00:07:18 are becoming more expensive, but smartphones are their own new type of category that aren't just there for making calls and texting. They're there for doing things like accessing the internet. So you can see how quickly this technology and communication technology is changing. Modern information technology uses lasers and fiber optics. These were introduced in the 1970s.
    00:07:42 Now, fiber optics are these small fibers that are extremely thin, thinner than a human hair, and light is used to transmit information by code, a flash on and off. So the pulses of light carried long distances along optical glass fibers. The first transatlantic cable was laid in 1988. Today, technology is used for the internet, cell phones, fax, and television.
    00:08:08 The impact of this, it's greatly increased the capacity, especially for international communications. And it's extremely fast. It's almost instantaneous. So if you think about it, after World War II, if you wanted to make an international call, you would have to call an operator directly who it would take several minutes for them to connect you to the line that you're going to be talking to overseas.
    00:08:33 And then it might be very staticky. Well, today, you can make a call overseas on your own instantaneous, and it's almost crystal-clear for you to listen to. It's also allowed for this information superhighway, where things are moving at very fast speeds, information not only via internet, but is also via fax and communication and television.
    00:09:00 It has also made it easier to do business around the world. People can be in one country and doing business with people in another country, looking at each other via videoconference. Now, just to review this section, advancements in transportation and communications technology have revolutionized our world. Intermodal containers allow goods to be shipped
    00:09:20 inexpensively across the world in days instead of months or years. Fiber optic communications have reduced information transmission times to a fraction of a second. The effects, trade has increased, and more companies are doing business around the world. Thanks so much for joining me in this section, and I look forward to seeing you in our next section.
    00:09:39 Have a great day. Bye.

! Section 3

    00:00:00 PROFESSOR: Hi. I'm Jane, your instructor. Welcome back to our discussion of international interdependence. This is section three. Our objective for this section is to evaluate the pros and cons of globalization. Remember, you may notice some terms are in bold and in blue.
    00:00:14 Pay close attention to those, because they're your vocabulary words. What is globalization? Goods, ideas, and technology spread around the world at breakneck speeds, and this is called globalization, the rapid travel of ideas, culture, goods, and information across national borders. Some examples are that the same goods and stores are
    00:00:32 found around the world. So some of the same restaurant chains that you're familiar with, if you were to go on vacation to somewhere in South America, Europe, or in Asia, you might be able to eat at some of those same restaurants that you're familiar with. Also, the idea that teens might play the same video games, watch the same television shows, and listen to the same music as teens all around the world.
    00:00:54 Now, most of these elements originate in the US and in Western Europe, and so this has often been referred to the Westernization of culture. And Japan is often included in this, because they have a Western style of government and economy. Now, notice this image. You can obviously see that this is an image taken from China, but you see an ad there featuring an NBA
    00:01:17 star, LeBron James. This is just one example of globalization, the fact that people in China would be interested in purchasing a product that is being marketed, that their spokesperson for this company is LeBron James. Economic interdependence and globalization go together. The world is increasingly connected. Information is transmitted instantaneously.
    00:01:44 It's easy and inexpensive to ship goods around the world. It's easy to do business around the world, and people around the world buy the same shoes, eat some of the same food, and watch some of the same TV shows. Well, is this good or bad? The opinions on this are really divided, and there's arguments for both. Some of the pros of globalization include the
    00:02:04 creation of a global village, the idea that there's more cooperation, that we can solve global problems together, and reduce the risk of war and conflict if we're working together towards similar goals, much like the story of the young girl who was sick in a Beijing hospital. Because she and her friends were able to communicate and then doctors were able to communicate around the world, they found a cure for her.
    00:02:31 The creation of a global marketplace. There's more options for countries and businesses. It leads to increased prosperity. There's also the increased availability of goods and services. There's more choices for consumers to make, and countries can affordably transport their goods to all those who are willing to purchase them.
    00:02:50 So because of globalization, we can buy more goods and services. We can buy goods that come from all around the world, because people are willing to ship them to places where people are willing to buy them. And there's the democratization of the world, increased freedom of speech and information, as well as more quality, especially for women.
    00:03:13 One example of this is women in India. More and more women in India are working, and this is something that was unheard of a generation ago. So you see that as this globalization-- as we become more like one world, one community, it impacts the rest of the world. It impacts all of us and creates situations for equality.
    00:03:39 Now, there are also some cons. Loss of job in some sectors. For example, if it's cheaper for a job to be done elsewhere, it probably will be. So if you work at a factory in manufacturing and your company decides that it will be cheaper for them to take that company and go someplace else in South America, in Africa, or in Asia to do business because they can pay people
    00:04:04 less money, they probably will do that. That has actually happened a number of times. Undesirable elements can spread more quickly. Well, just as culture-- things like television, movies, music, ideas-- can spread quickly, so can things that we maybe don't want to spread quickly, like disease. Take for example after World War I, there was a flu
    00:04:28 epidemic that killed millions of people. It took 18 months to spread around the world. Well, today, a flu that could be deadly for some people can spread around in just a few days, because so many people are flying all over the world, and you have people in contact with one another on a daily basis from all over the world. Terrorism can spread quickly, as well as drugs and weapons. They can move through various countries quickly and easily.
    00:04:59 Also, it's giving corporations more and more power, since in a large way, when we're talking about this idea of globalization, we mean based on goods and services, not just based on ideas. We're also meaning some of the products that are actually being created and sold. They don't have checks on their power in the same way that governments do, so they can do things that if they
    00:05:25 were governments, they might not be able to get away with. And one thing is some people think that they're taking advantage of some of the poor or underdeveloped or developing countries. Big corporations maybe that are Western companies are going to places where they can pay people really cheaply and then paying them cheaply because they can, rather than paying them maybe what might be a fair wage.
    00:05:48 Because if they were in the United States, they would have to pay employees a lot more. So they might exploit these weaker countries, and this can create a situation where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. There's also a loss of cultural diversity. Countries, regions, and cities begin to lose their uniqueness as all things start to look the same, just in that you can
    00:06:09 go to some restaurants and coffee shops that you go to here almost anywhere in the world. Now, just to review this section, we see that globalization is the rapid travel of ideas, culture, goods, and information across national borders. Economic interdependence has increased the effect of globalization. People disagree whether this is a good
    00:06:30 thing or a bad thing. Pros include increased trade and prosperity and more cooperation. Some of the cons, undesirable elements spread, and people who live in weaker countries may be exploited. Our world is increasingly interconnected. Kids around the world buy the same shoes, NBA jerseys, and other goods.
    00:06:51 They play the same video games and watch the same movies. They chat online and post pictures to the same websites, even though they live thousands of miles apart. Do you think this trend towards globalization will continue in the future? How might it impact your life? How do you think it will impact you when you join the workforce as an adult?
    00:07:11 Do you think globalization is good or bad? Spend some time thinking about that. I hope that you've learned something interesting in this lesson, and I hope that you have a great day. Thanks again for joining me. Bye now
