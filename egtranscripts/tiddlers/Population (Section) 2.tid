title: Population (Section) 2
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

 00:00:02 PROFESSOR: Hello, my name is Mr. Wagner. Welcome back to section three of our lesson titled Population. Let's begin by looking at our objective for the section which is to understand population density. Now so far, we've defined population, we've talked about reasons for which populations grown and decline. We've also studied population growth rates.
00:00:24 Well, now we're going to focus on population density, which is the measure of the size of the population relative to an area's land size. So we're essentially looking at how crowded a specific area is. If you look here, look at this picture on your left. You can see this appears to be an area with relatively low population density.
00:00:46 This is when we have few people living together in a specific area. Now here is your picture on the right, this looks terrifyingly crowded. This is an area with high population density, where we have many people living together in a specific area. Now geographers use maps to indicate population density, or to show population density.
00:01:10 And the areas are shaded based on their levels of population density. So here on our map, we have our lighter shades of yellow which indicate areas of low population density. We also have our darker shades of red, which indicate areas of high population density. So this is how geographers illustrate population density around the world.
00:01:34 And as you can see, populations are not evenly distributed. We can see, we're going to zoom in here, on Europe and Asia. We can see these are actually some of the most highly populated areas in the world. In Europe we have just over 700 million people living in this region, and you can see the dark red spots of areas of
00:01:53 high population density. East Asia, extremely populated region, this includes China, Mongolia, the Koreas, as well as Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Some of the most highly populated areas in the world. And this totals to a population of just under 1.6 billion people. And the most populated area or region in the world, is the
00:02:16 Indian subcontinent. South Asia, if you will. And this includes India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, as well as Pakistan. And you can see here, these relatively large dark areas of red. These are areas with very high population density. And again this region totals about 1.6 billion people.
00:02:40 We're going to zoom in here on Japan. And as you can see here, we have these dark shades of red. These areas of dark red. Now these are our highest areas, with the highest population density. And these are our cities and towns in Japan, or our urban areas. Urban areas are our most populated areas, or areas with
00:03:02 the highest population density. And again, these are cities and towns. And in Japan this is specifically Tokyo, and Osaka. Now many geographers believe Tokyo to be the largest city in the world, so this is one of the most highly populated cities with the highest population density. Now here we have a picture of a rural area. So this is the opposite of an urban area.
00:03:27 So urban areas again, are cities and towns. While rural areas are the countryside. And this is an area with relatively low population density. But what has been happening over time, is the world is becoming more urban. People are moving from the countryside and settling in the cities throughout the world.
00:03:46 And we call this a process of urbanization. So they're moving from the rural areas, the countryside, and they're moving to the urban areas. We're going to call this urbanization. Now this is a process that has been happening for awhile. And as early as 1950, as we can see here in this graph, we have nearly 3/4 of the world's population living in the countryside, living in rural areas.
00:04:10 And as early as 2008, right around this time period, for the first time in the world's history, there were more people living in urban areas, in our cities and towns, than living in the countryside. And this trend seems to be continuing. It's projected, it looks like with this graph, by 2050 to have nearly 3/4 of the world's population living in urban areas instead of in the countrysides.
00:04:37 So interesting development that has been occurring for the last 50 years or so. So let's review this section. We introduced population density that measures the number of people living together in a given area relative to the area's land size, so essentially, how crowded an area is. And some of the most densely populated areas, again, are
00:05:02 South and East Asia. And we can see, as we saw with our graph, or our map of the world with population density, the populations are not evenly distributed around the world. We have much more of the world's population located in East and South Asia than anywhere else. Urban populations, we introduced urban and rural populations, urban being the towns and cities, rural being
00:05:26 the countryside. And we have a process that we just talked about of urbanization, where people are moving from the countrysides and settling in urban areas. And this process of urbanization seems to be, it's projected I should say, to continue into the future. So what happens? So we know that this process of urbanization is probably
00:05:50 going to continue. So what happens when the populations in cities continue to grow? When people continue to leave the countryside and move into these cities? Well let's take it back to our example from the introduction of section one. When you're planning a party.
00:06:06 When you plan a party, you need to plan ahead. You need to figure out how many people are coming, plan for the amount of food that you're going to need, plan for the number of chairs and tables you're going to need. Well this is called planning, and you're planning based on the number of people you expect to be at your party. Well the same goes for governments and cities around the world.
00:06:26 Government leaders, and leaders in the cities, need to plan ahead for future populations. They need to study population growth and decline, so that they are prepared to support those rising populations. So again, preparing. It's all in the preparedness. How prepared are you for these rising populations? It's central at being prepared for these rising populations,
00:06:52 is actually studying population. And the reasons for which populations grow and decline. So that is it for our lesson on population. I thank you for your attention, I hope you've learned something new.
