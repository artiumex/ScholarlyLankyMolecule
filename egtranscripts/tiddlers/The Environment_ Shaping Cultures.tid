title: The Environment: Shaping Cultures
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

! Section 1

    00:00:01 PROFESSOR: Hi, my name is Kirsten. And I'm your instructor today. Here's a picture of the ancient city of Petra. In the year 350 it was a thriving trade city located on the route between Damascus and the Red Sea in the middle of the Jordanian desert. You may wonder how a city flourished in this very harsh environment.
    00:00:21 Well, as you can imagine, they had to harness every bit of available water, from building dams to control flooding of dry riverbeds, whenever it happened to rain, to constructing vast underground cisterns to hold water and protect it from evaporation. Well the city of Petra shows us how resilient man is. How they can build a city, even in the harshest environments and still manage to survive.
    00:00:45 And in this lecture we are going to be looking at this relationship between man and his environment. We're looking at the environment and how it shapes culture. Our objective is to explore the effects of environment on culture, to identify environmental factors that contribute to settlement patterns, the establishment of settlement and the formation of culture and to examine the
    00:01:05 effect of environmental diseases on specific cultures and identify efforts to eradicate or control these diseases. We'll be looking at our first objective in this section. And as we go along some of our words and terms will be highlighted in purple. Pay close attention, because these are part of your vocabulary for this lesson.
    00:01:22 Take a moment to look at this photo. And you can imagine that life in this city is very different than if we compared it to life in a village located next to a river. Or if we compared life to a village along the ocean or by the sea. So humankind must always adapt the way we live depending upon the environment around us.
    00:01:45 And the study of this phenomenon is called cultural ecology, the study of the relationship between a society and its natural environment. Now environment has a major influence on social structures and on human institution. And culture can equally influence the environment. In that photo we saw, of course the culture of that city required that we build our houses and build them into
    00:02:08 the side of the nearby mountain. Now cultures vary on their attitudes towards the environment. And really we see societies fall into two major belief systems. First that man should live as a part of nature, man should live in harmony with the environment. But more commonly, especially throughout the Western world, we see the second attitude.
    00:02:31 That man is above nature and the environment should be subjugated by man. So in this lesson we're going to be looking at the environmental factors that we can see in cultures around the world. Cultures are influenced by the type of climate, by the food and plants native to a region, by the proximity to fresh water, as well as to the geographic proximity to other
    00:02:54 civilizations, or the absence, or a location of geographic barriers. On top of that, the fact of the environment can be seen in housing, in folktales, in traditional religions, as well as in cuisine. And in this first section these are the factors we're going to be looking at. So we're going to start with geography and the effects
    00:03:16 geography has on culture. Here we see an image of the ancient city of Machu Picchu. This is part of the Mayan civilization. And you can see here it's located on a mountain top. Well you can imagine that geographic barriers likely existed between this civilization and nearby civilizations. And that likely affected how this civilization developed.
    00:03:36 And you would be correct. So culture is influenced by geographic barriers as well as geographic proximity. So when cultures interact freely with other cultures we see the spread of cultural elements. Islam, for example, spread quickly across the Middle East because there were no geographic barriers. On the Indian subcontinent few geographic barriers protected
    00:04:00 this region from invasion. So we see the Indian culture today is a mix of many different cultures. Europe had very strong trade relationships. And that culture was built on those relationships as well. However, like Machu Picchu, some societies form culture in isolation. Geographic barriers can prevent the influence of
    00:04:21 outside factors. Japan, for example, was an island nation, so it formed its culture in geographic isolation. The Inca civilization was surrounded by mountains. Today, however, the facts of this have been mitigated because of transportation and technological advancement. Now it's very difficult for cultures to remain isolated. Because of the internet and satellites and so forth we
    00:04:44 tend to share information much more quickly today. Let's take a look at another effect that the physical environment can have on a culture. One is housing styles. In Norway, for example, we see these very, very steeply pitched roofs, which are necessary to make sure that snow can slide off the roof easily. In Iceland we see the houses are buried under sod to hold
    00:05:09 the heat in, because it's a very cold environment. In Australia we see houses built up off the ground. This aids in air circulation to keep houses cool. And in Vietnam we see houses built on stilts. We also see this on the Gulf Coast in the United States and in the Southeastern of the United States, all along the waterfront, to protect from tropical storms as they come in.
    00:05:33 So now we're going to turn the focus to looking at a few case studies. And in these civilizations we're going to look at we're going to see the effects the environment had on the development of culture in these locations. We're going to start with the Pueblo Indians. And you can see this very, very distinct style of architecture.
    00:05:51 Well the Pueblo Indian culture was heavily influenced by their environment. They built apartment-like dwellings, either freestanding or into the sides of cliffs. And they were often made of adobe, because that was locally available materials. We see this often, is that cultures tend to build homes out of things that are available easily.
    00:06:17 In addition, they also used locally available animals for food and clothing. Next let's take a look at the Faroe Islands. And you can see here that the people that live here are killing some pilot whales. And we're going to talk about that in this lesson. The Faroe islands are located about halfway between Britain and Iceland in the middle of the North Atlantic.
    00:06:41 They were settled by Norse and Scandinavian peoples and now belong to Denmark. And they have a very long tradition of fishing and whaling-- in fact, their economies is almost totally dependent upon these industries. Still for generations they have conducted some controversial pilot whale hunts. Passing pods of whales are driven into shore.
    00:07:02 They're basically beached on purpose. And then the people come down and slaughter the whales with hooks and knives. Now this may seem very foreign to us. It may seem inhumane to us. But what is important to remember is that this has been a tradition in these societies for a very long time. The whales are slaughtered for a purpose.
    00:07:24 The meat and blubber are distributed evenly among community members. And for generations, the people of these islands have been dependent upon that meat to survive. There's very little arable land. Less than 2% of the land on the islands can be farmed. And so, again, whale meat and whale blubber are a very important part of the Faroese diet.
    00:07:47 Finally, let's take a look at Hawaii. And we can see elements of nature right here in this performance. Although the clothing is not authentic, we do see the leis made from beads that are made of naturally available materials. We see on their heads the leaf leis around their head. We see instruments also made from
    00:08:13 locally available materials. So the Hawaiian culture is based upon those Polynesian traditions. And the Polynesian people spread across the Pacific around 300 BCE. And the Hawaiian language, for example, is very similar to other Polynesian languages. The cultural elements found in Hawaii are clearly linked to
    00:08:31 the environment. For example, the traditional Hawaiian religion is based heavily upon the environment, for example, Pele, the goddess of volcanoes, of course, Hawaii is known for its active volcanoes, Paka'a, the god of the wind and sail. The hula dance, for example, is a part of the religion. Of course, the lei-- typically you see flower leis.
    00:08:56 Again, these are flowers grown locally in Hawaii. Also folktales, one of the most famous folktales is about Laka, an adventurer who sails from island to island on a canoe. So, in review, we talked about the idea of cultural ecology, the study of the relationship between culture and the environment. And we know that the
    00:09:17 environment influences religion. It influences housing and the types of homes people build. It influences folktales as well as what people eat. So we're going to take a little break. And when we get back we're going to be looking at other elements of culture around the world and their relationship with the environment. So hang on.
    00:09:35 And I'll see you in just a minute.

! Section 2

    00:00:02 PROFESSOR: Hi, welcome back. This lesson is the environment shaping cultures. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section we'll be looking at our second objective. To identify environmental factors that contribute to settlement patterns, the establishment of settlements, and the formation of culture. Well in our first section, we took a look at
    00:00:20 cultures around the world. And how we see elements of the environment in them. In this section we're really going to focus on location, why are certain locations chosen for settlement. And we're really focusing on older settlements, so the first settlements in human history. And what we find is that the early settlements in human history were entirely dependent upon the
    00:00:40 environment. So where they were chosen was dependent upon the environment, and what people did there to survive as well. So we see foraging societies, we see horticulture and agricultural societies, and we also see nomadic herding. And what type of society developed depended upon the environment. Now increased technology resulted in more sophisticated
    00:01:03 settlement. So eventually these settlements are going to evolve into towns and villages, and then of course finally cities. So let's take a look first at foraging societies. Foraging means living off the land, without modifying it. And these are the earliest settlements in human history. They were highly mobile, people could only take what
    00:01:24 they could carry. So they lived in very small groups, and every person maybe carried a few things. But they didn't have a lot of personal possessions, because of course they couldn't carry it from place to place to place year round. Now they were also nomadic, meaning that they moved about the countryside in search of seasonal food supply.
    00:01:45 So they may have followed game, for example. There was little formal social structure, there were little elements of government for example. Instead people lived together with social ties based on kinship. So these were very large extended family groups, and they were very heavily dependent upon each other for survival.
    00:02:03 So there was a lot of sharing of property, sharing of whatever is caught, or whatever is forged, and so forth. Next we have horticultural societies. So we're seeing the shift from foraging to horticulture. Horticultural societies are those which have shifted from food collection to food production. So for the first time people are starting to plant things.
    00:02:26 And we're not talk about huge agriculture, we're talking about a little bit of planting and a little bit of harvesting what is planted. Horticulture means plant cultivation using primitive tools, so we're not talking about using tractors and fertilizers and things like that. We're talking about having a rake and a hoe, and we're gardening for example.
    00:02:47 The transition to horticulture began about 12,000 years ago, and most practiced shifting cultivation. So what this means is that people did not stay in one place forever. They stayed in one place, they farmed, and then what would happen is after a few years the soil wouldn't be very good. So they would have to find a new place to farm, so they
    00:03:09 still moved from place to place. And of course they still supported their agriculture with foraging. So these are very early agricultural settlements, and again they were not stationary. Whatever yield that they had from farming would likely be very small. So we're not talking about lots and lots of fields, we're
    00:03:27 talking about small plots that would be farmed. And again, supporting it with hunting and gathering and so forth. Now these elements again remained small, and we find these type of settlements around the world. Now next we have what's called nomadic herding settlements. Nomadic herding is the controlled movement of livestock, dependent upon natural forage.
    00:03:51 So again, if you have a herd of goats. You take them someplace, you let them eat the grass there, and then after a few days when the grass is gone, or a few weeks, you're going to move them to a new location. So again you're still nomadic, you're moving from place to place, but again instead of looking for food so much you're really finding food for your flock, or for your herd, or whatever.
    00:04:14 Again highly mobile settlements, they had to search not only for food, but also for water supplies. And they may have had some permanent settlements with some farming. So perhaps there is a farm, a little house somewhere that would be more permanent, there would be a little bit of farming there. And then a couple members of the family would take the herd
    00:04:34 from place to place to place, and then use the home as the base of operations. Now all the types of herding that went on included cattle, sheep, goats, and other livestock. And this is very typically found in drier climates with grasslands. So in central Asia for example. And typically these areas were not great for farming, they
    00:04:55 were more marginal areas, so even though they won't support farming and agriculture in a large scale they will support food for livestock and cattle and so forth. Now the next big development that we see is the growth of agricultural settlements. So agricultural societies developed from these early horticultural and nomadic herding societies. So eventually what happens is people find ways to make
    00:05:22 farming more successful, they find ways to get bigger yields from what they plant, and so they don't have to forage as much. They don't have to hunt as much, they don't have to move their cattle or their herd of goats as often. So these sites are specifically chosen based on farming suitability, and the first of these agricultural settlements were all founded in river valleys.
    00:05:46 So in ancient Egypt, in the Indus River Valley, in south India in-- not in south India but in south Asia-- in Mesopotamia. The fertile crescent area, what is present day Iraq. Because they had good fresh water sources, and these rivers tended to flood. And when the river flooded, it brought up lots of good soil
    00:06:08 from the river bed onto the field, making the fields much more fertile. So again these sites were specifically chosen for this suitability, and they started to develop more advanced technology. So things like irrigation, to irrigate their crops year round, plows that can be pulled by animals to make planting more efficient.
    00:06:28 And what's important to note though is that these civilizations were highly dependent upon water supplies. So if the river changed, if the climate changed a little bit, if they didn't get rainfall over a long period of time, the settlement would be abandoned. Because again, it didn't have that suitable sustained water supply that's necessary to survive. So with the development of agricultural societies, we
    00:06:52 start to see the development of towns and cities. So intensive agriculture led to these bigger settlements. Bigger agricultural yields could support a growing population. So as we plant more, as we get more from what we plant, more and more people can live in our settlement. So we start to see our first towns, that are then going to grow into our first urban areas.
    00:07:13 And in addition to these agricultural yields, we start to have the diversification of labor. So now it doesn't take all of our population to make sure everyone's fed. Now a few people in our population can feed us, and then the rest of our population can do something else. We can start metal working, we can start creating jewelry.
    00:07:30 We can start making and weaving cloth, and dying cloth, and so forth. So we start to see the diversification of labor, and we start to see the growth of culture. You can't start to have a religion if everyone is working so hard to bring food in. You can't have priests, and some of the complex things that we think about with the religion.
    00:07:49 So again, culture's going to develop once those food supplies are secure. Now the success of these towns and cities again relied on the environmental advantages. So water resources, barriers to protect our city from invasion, or from people coming and raiding. Metal or ore resources that we can then make into tools, make into jewelry, that we can then trade for other goods.
    00:08:16 So an example of a city that flourished is Rome. Now the earliest settlements of Rome date to about 750 B.C.E. Now Rome is located on a peninsula, so there's some natural barriers. There's mountains to the north, it's surrounded by ocean, so again it can protect it from invading peoples. The soil was very fertile. Rome is located again on Italy, volcanic in nature.
    00:08:43 So again volcanic soil is very fertile soil. And Rome itself, the site of the city, was chosen very carefully. It was chosen on the Tiber River, but not just anywhere on Tiber River. There's one spot on the Tiber River which is very wide in most places, where there is an island. So by choosing to locate Rome there, they could construct a
    00:09:02 bridge across to the island and then from the island across to the other side. So it was a natural crossing point, and the river was too wide to be crossed for miles in either direction. So Rome is going to become a very important center of trade, because again it's the only place you can get across the river. So in review, we talked about the
    00:09:22 characteristics of location. How the environment really decides what kind of settlement we're going to develop. Especially in the ancient days of the first human settlements. Nomadic foragers followed game, so they were highly mobile. Horticulture and herding supplemented hunting and
    00:09:40 gathering later. And eventually of course, we're going to see the development of agricultural settlements. And environmental factors are increasingly important as those settlements become more sophisticated. Water resources are needed for intensive agriculture, and it's going to allow for the development of those more sophisticated larger settlements.
    00:10:00 Our first towns, and then later cities, and urban areas, that are going to become those important centers of trade. So we're going to take a little break, and when we get back we're going to be looking at another environmental factor. The one that's particularly important today, and that's disease. What do the environment and disease have to
    00:10:16 do with each other? So I'll see you in just a second.

! Section 3

    00:00:02 Hi, welcome back. This lesson is The Environment, Shaping Cultures. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here and in this section we'll be looking at our third objective-- to examine the effects of environmental diseases on specific cultures, and identify efforts to eradicate or control these diseases. Well, in this lesson we've been learning about the
    00:00:21 effects of the environment on culture, and the effects of culture on the environment. Well, one very interesting effect is that if you've lived in certain parts of the world, in certain environments you are at more risk for disease. Some diseases are simply more prevalent in certain environments. For example, if you live in an agricultural society around
    00:00:39 lots of people who are herders, or deal with animals, you are more likely to contract influenza strains, Anthrax, or a disease called, Rift Valley fever, which is growing in prominence in Africa and the Middle East. If you live in a continental forest area, you're more likely to contract a disease that's carried by ticks. For example, Lyme disease is carried by deer ticks and it's much more prevalent in the Northern United States and in
    00:01:06 New England. Areas with high mosquito infestations are at much greater risk for diseases like West Nile virus, Yellow fever, and Dengue fever and Malaria. Now global trade and travel means that once a disease breaks out it is going to spread much more quickly today than it did hundreds or thousands of years ago. So let's take a look at one way that we measure the effect
    00:01:30 of disease on a population. This is a map called Disability- Adjusted Life Year and it's what the World Health Organization uses to measure the effect of disease, as well as, poor health conditions to measure its effect on the population, including lower life expectancy, for example. And we can see areas in red, especially here in Southern Africa, disease is more prevalent.
    00:01:56 A life expectancy is lower. We can also see other pockets, as well, but those are caused by war, not just the environment. So let's take a look at Disability- Adjusted Life Year. Now tropical and subtropical climates such as those found in Southern Africa are most at risk for infectious disease. Disease carrying insects like mosquitoes thrive.
    00:02:19 It results in widespread illness and loss of life. And again, the Disability- Adjusted Life Year is the measurement we use to calculate this effect. Now diseases can have an enormous impact in this part of the world. It can have a demographic impact, higher infant mortality, lower life expectancy. Social impacts include people having to adopt a new habit,
    00:02:41 live in a new way to prevent the spread of disease. These traditions must often be changed in order to fight the spread of disease. Economic impact, of course, is substantial. Higher health care costs, the costs for fighting the disease once people get sick, lost workdays for the sick and caregivers, also can negatively impact economic growth as well as simply the cost of drugs that
    00:03:05 people have to take. Often these countries that suffer from disease outbreaks are very, very poor and so the government must provide drugs to treat the sick and infected. As a result, we may see a negative impact on economic growth. So the first study, a case that we're going to look at, the first disease, is malaria.
    00:03:25 And areas in the darkest red are those areas most susceptible to the spread of malaria. The orange and yellow are less. So malaria is one of the most widespread diseases that is negatively impacting world populations, commonly found in tropical and subtropical environments. Around the world 300 million people are infected and one to two million people will die of malaria related
    00:03:50 complications each year. Now, malaria causes 20 percent of all childhood deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa and it has a significant negative economic impact. Health care costs are up to 40 percent of expenditure in some nations. So some nations in Africa, what their government spends on everything, on transportation, schools, on
    00:04:15 pensions, whatever, 40 percent of what the government spends is on health care costs. And it's malaria, it's aids, it's poor health care in general. But we can see that negative impact can be worse with malaria. Now in addition, malaria can result in a negative GDP reduction of one percent in infected nations.
    00:04:37 So on top of that, the economy is not doing as well, also because of malaria. Now the next disease we're going to be looking at in this lesson is dengue fever. Dengue fever is growing in many parts of the world and unlike malaria, which we typically see in rural areas, dengue fever is more commonly found in Urban areas. And you can see areas in red are where they have had
    00:05:00 confirmed cases of dengue fever, and areas in blue are where they have found the mosquitoes that carry dengue fever. So these are the areas most at risk for the spread of the disease. And you can see the southeastern United States is included. So dengue fever is a growing threat in much of the world.
    00:05:17 It's a severe flu-like illness found in Urban areas in tropical regions. It's very prevalent. More than 50 million cases per year and it's endemic in more than 100 countries in Latin America, in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean. So endemic means it's a very commonly found illness in this particular area or climate.
    00:05:40 Approximately two and a half percent of people who catch dengue fever die from complications from the disease, and there is concern that it is spreading into the United States. So let's take a look at malaria and dengue fever. Both of them are caused by mosquitoes and the spread of this disease is dependent heavily upon environmental factors.
    00:06:01 The climate can affect the number and survival of the mosquito population. For example, rainfall, temperature, and humidity changes means that it can be easier for mosquitoes to thrive and therefore spread the disease. It's highly seasonal. The transmission rates peak during and just after the rainy season because again, mosquitoes need water to breed
    00:06:24 and mosquitoes lay their eggs on the water. So when there's standing water around, the mosquito population thrive. Which is sometimes, if you live in areas with high mosquito population, you may hear the newscasters tell people to eliminate standing water, which means getting rid of kids swimming pools that you just fill up with the hose, or old tires where water can collect in the
    00:06:46 bottom of the tire. Another way to prevent malaria and dengue fever is by sleeping under a bed net. And you can see bed nets here. They're treated with a special insecticide. So if mosquitoes do land on the nets, the mosquitoes will die. So there are two ways to spread
    00:07:05 malaria and dengue fever. The first way is you have to end the infection in the population. Because again, the mosquitoes spread the disease from person to person by biting an infected person and then biting an uninfected person. That's how the disease spreads. So by sleeping under insecticide treated bed nets,
    00:07:22 that's one way to end the infection in the population. There's been a huge push in Sub-Saharan Africa to get everyone to sleep under these nets. Again, to eliminate the threat of malaria, spraying the interior of walls and surfaces inside the house or inside the office, drugs that can prevent you from catching the disease, however, these drugs are very, very expensive, and they are working on vaccines for both dengue fever and malaria but
    00:07:49 they have not been able to come up with one yet. The second way to prevent the spread of these diseases is to eradicate the mosquitoes themselves. So going out and spraying outside, as well as eliminating standing water which mosquitoes need to breed. So in review, we talked about the fact that some diseases are endemic or more prevalent in certain environments,
    00:08:14 including malaria, which is very prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, and dengue fever, which is a growing problem in tropical areas around the world. Diseases can impact the populations. They can lower life expectancy, economic cost can be significant for increased health care costs or lost workdays, and altering people's lifestyles when you have to sleep under a bed net or you have to spray the
    00:08:40 interior home for insecticide. The fact that you have a high risk of disease can cause you to live your life in a different way. So in this lesson we learned all about the relationship between the environment in culture. We talked about how people choose places to live, why we choose, especially in the past, the city's to be located in certain places.
    00:09:01 We talked about how the environment can affect the type of early settlements that were created, and we also talked about the effect of the environment on the cultures of civilizations across the world. So I'd like you to take a look at these pictures. This is some pictures that are characteristic of the New England culture from the fishing industry important to the economy, to lobster, that people enjoy as a part of
    00:09:25 their diet, to the beaches that people visit during the summer, to the type of housing that is constructed, covered in wooden shingles, for example, because that is a locally available material. So I'd like you to think about your environment and how it affects your culture. What type of climate do you live in? What are the building materials that are readily
    00:09:44 available in your area? What do the houses look like? Are they indicative of the environment? And what about the things that you like to do? Do you live near the ocean, so you like to surf? Or maybe you live in the mountains so you like to snowboard. So what relationship do you see between the environment
    00:09:59 and your culture and I'd like you to think about those things. So have a great day and I'll see you next time. Bye.
