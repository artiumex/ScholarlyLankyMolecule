title: World Geography: Western Hemisphere
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

! Section 1
00:00:00
TEACHER: In this lesson, we are working to answer the question, how can you describe the geography of the Western Hemisphere? So far, we've learned how to locate the Western Hemisphere on a map. In the next part of our lesson, we're going to learn to describe the physical geography
00:00:16
of the Western Hemisphere. And this includes learning about its mountain ranges, deserts, and other landforms, as well as bodies of water. So let's get to it.

! Section 2
00:00:00
TEACHER: Let's look at the map and see which landmasses make up the Western Hemisphere. Now remember there are two continents making up the Western Hemisphere--so we have North America and South America. And North America extends all the way from Alaska in the North to the Isthmus of Panama
00:00:18
down to the South. There are only two continents in the Northern Hemisphere. But there is a region in between North and South America that is actually referred to as Central America. What are some of the physical features that make up the geography in the Western Hemisphere? Well, let's find out. North America can be divided into regions.
00:00:38
And these are areas that share similar physical characteristics. Here we see that there are eight different regions represented. The key with the colors shows us the different names of each region. So we have the coastal range, the basin range, the Rocky Mountains, the Great Plains, the interior lowlands, the Canadian Shield, the Appalachian Mountains,
00:00:56
and the coastal plains. Now each region's name is related to its location. So for example, the Rocky Mountains are called that because they extend through the Rocky Mountain range. Now let's learn about the physical geography of North America. So one way that we can describe the physical geography
00:01:15
of the Western Hemisphere is by identifying the major mountain ranges of North America. So let's take a look at some of these major mountain ranges. So we have the Cascade Range that is located here. And this extends throughout--you can see--the Western side of the United States. It actually contains a number of summits which are extinct volcanoes.
00:01:36
Summits, of course, means the top of the mountain. And then extinct means that it's no longer active. We also see the Rocky Mountains. And they're located here. The Rocky Mountains are North America's longest chain of mountains. And then finally we have the Appalachians. And these are the oldest mountain range on the Earth.
00:01:56
We see them located here. You can see that these three major mountain ranges spread out across the United States. Let's take a closer look at the deserts of North America. So deserts are another important land form in the Western Hemisphere. And they also have very distinct features. So a desert in general is dry land area
00:02:16
that receives very little precipitation throughout the year. Precipitation, of course, is rainfall. So let's check out some of the most significant deserts in North America. So first we have the Great Basin. Great Basin is located here, and it is the largest desert in North America.
00:02:33
It is actually a cold desert, though, and receives most of its precipitation in snow rather than rain. Next we have the Mojave Desert located here. And the Mojave Desert experiences extreme daily temperatures. So these temperatures can range from 49.8 degrees Fahrenheit all the way to 75.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
00:02:55
And then finally we have the Sonoran Desert. The Sonoran Desert contains very unique animal and plant life. One such example is it's home to the kangaroo rat. And it never has to actually drink water. It also has a cactus that can live to be over 250 years old. Wow. And the Sonoran Desert is located here. So we've learned about deserts which
00:03:17
have very little precipitation. Now let's talk about places where we find plenty of water. These are the major bodies of water in North America. So so far, we've looked at landforms in the Western Hemisphere. We're now going to move on to learn about different bodies of water found in North America. Notice some of the major bodies of water
00:03:35
that we see here on the map. So we see both the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Let's take a look at each of these. So first, the Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean in the world. It actually covers approximately 41 million square miles. Then we have the Pacific Ocean. And it is the largest ocean in the world.
00:03:53
And this one covers 70 million square miles. This ocean actually extends from the Arctic down to Antarctica and from the Americas to Asia and Australia. We also see located on the map the Bering Sea. And the Bering Sea is actually between Alaska and Russia, as you see here on the map. Let's take a look at some slightly smaller but still very important bodies of water in North America.
00:04:18
So North America is home to various bodies of water. And these include lakes, gulfs, and bays. Let's take a look at each of these. So first, a bay is actually a coastal body of water partially surrounded by land. But it connects to something larger. So the example we're looking at here is the Hudson Bay. The Hudson Bay is relatively shallow.
00:04:38
The water temperature peaks at just 48 degrees Fahrenheit. Now moving on to another body of water that's really important is a lake. A lake is a body of water that is completely surrounded by land. A great example of these are the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes is the largest group of freshwater lakes on Earth.
00:04:56
The Great Lakes, of course, consist of Lake Huron, Lake Ontario, Lake Michigan, Lake Erie, and Lake Superior. They're all connected by a series of rivers. Finally, another important body of water are gulfs. Now a gulf is technically a very large bay. The example we're looking at here is the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico connects the Atlantic Ocean
00:05:20
and the Caribbean Sea. It is partially surrounded by the US, Mexico, and Cuba. Now let's look at the inland bodies of water in North America. So in addition to oceans, seas, bays, and straits, North America is also home to some pretty impressive rivers. Let's look at two of these rivers that are really important to North America.
00:05:42
These are the Missouri River and the Mississippi River. They're actually two of the longest rivers in all of North America. Check them out on the map-- Missouri and Mississippi. Now the Missouri River begins at the Rocky Mountains and then joins up with the Mississippi River. So it begins at the Rocky Mountains.
00:06:00
And the Mississippi River is 2,320 miles long. And it actually empties into the Gulf of Mexico. We're now going to learn about another landform that is considered part of North America. These are the Hawaiian Islands. The Hawaiian Islands are located just west of the mainland. The mainland, of course, is the main body of North America, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
00:06:27
The Hawaiian Islands, believe it or not, is made up of 8 major islands. The islands cover an area of 1,500 miles all the way around. The islands were originally formed by volcanic activity underneath the ocean-- cool. Let's see what you remember about the physical geography of North America.
00:06:46
Landforms, oceans, rivers, Hawaiian Islands, oh my-- good luck.

! Section 4
00:00:00
TEACHER: Just as North America can be divided into physical regions that share similar physical characteristics, so too can South America. Let's explore the four different physical regions. Check out this map of South America. So some things you may recognize.
00:00:15
You may know the Andes Mountains, or maybe you know the Amazon River. But there are other regions in the continent as well. Let's take a look at some of these regions. The mountainous regions include the Andes, of course, as well as the Guiana Highlands and the Brazilian Highlands. There's another region called the Grasslands or Lowlands, and these include Pampas and Patagonia.
00:00:38
We also have the rain forests or flood lands region, and this includes, of course, the Amazon Basin and the Llanos. And then finally, we have the desert region which consists of the Atacama Desert. We will take a look at each of these regions a little further. Let's begin first with the major mountain ranges in South America.
00:00:57
So know that South America has three major mountain ranges, and they are listed here. So here are three. First, we're going to check out the Andes. It's important because it is the world's longest mountain range. It extends 5,500 miles from the northern coast of South America all the way to the tip. The Andes also contains hundreds of peaks,
00:01:22
which are, of course, the tops of mountains, and many of them are volcanic. Pretty cool. The other major mountain range are the Brazilian Highlands. And the Brazilian Highlands are a low mountain region, and they're made up of hills and broad, flatland areas. These are high lands called plateaus. And then we also see the Guiana Highlands.
00:01:42
The Guiana Highlands are another low mountain region similar to the Brazilian Highlands. Let's take a look at some of the major deserts in South America. So South America has two major deserts. They are the Patagonia Desert and the Atacama Desert. Here they are on the map. We see the Atacama Desert as well as the Patagonian Desert. Let's take a look at each of these.
00:02:01
So first, the Patagonian Desert is the largest desert in South America. It covers an area of 470,377 square miles. Wow. And then the Atacama Desert is just about 600 to 700 miles long. It contains an area known as the driest place on Earth. And it's also the highest desert in the world
00:02:24
at 13,000 feet above sea level. It is the driest part. Therefore no rainfall has actually ever been recorded there. Wow. Now let's learn about some other land forms. This time we're going to take a look at Central America. So remember, the Western hemisphere is also
00:02:40
home to the Isthmus of Panama as well as the Yucatan Peninsula. Here's a map showing Central America. Remember we spoke about this earlier. This is that area in between North America and South America. Specifically, it falls right in between Mexico and then the top of South America. The Isthmus of Panama and the Yucatan Peninsula
00:03:00
serve two really important functions in Central America. So first, the Isthmus of Panama, which is located here, it connects North America with South America. It sort of acts like a bridge between the two continents. Remember that an isthmus is a narrow area of land that connects two larger land areas. And then we also see the Yucatan Peninsula. And the Yucatan Peninsula is important
00:03:24
because it separates the Gulf of Mexico from the Caribbean Sea. Remember that a peninsula is a piece of land that is almost entirely surrounded by water, but it is attached to a larger land area. So here on the map, we see the Yucatan Peninsula, and again, it helps to form the Gulf of Mexico as it separates it from the Caribbean Sea. Next, we'll explore an important body of water in South America.
00:03:48
So this body of water is the Amazon River. The Amazon River is the largest river in the whole world. It actually, in terms of volume of water, that's why it's called the largest. It's found in, of course, South America. Take a look. Here it is on the map. Now glacial streams from the Andes
00:04:06
feed directly into the Amazon River. The whole river is approximately 4,000 miles long. And check this fact out. It empties 7,381,000 cubic feet of water into the Atlantic Ocean every second. That's amazing. The Amazon River also has some smaller rivers that extend out from it, as you can see here on the map.
00:04:30
These rivers are a life source for the entire Amazon Basin region. Another important land form in the Western hemisphere are the Caribbean Islands. Let's check those out. The Caribbean Islands are often referred to all together because they are all located in the Caribbean Sea. Here they're labeled individually on the map,
00:04:49
though, because they do all have individual names. Like the US state of Hawaii, each Caribbean island formed from a series of volcanoes under the ocean, and the islands have diverse physical geography. So some have a flat landscape, whereas others have towering rugged mountain ranges like those found in Cuba. The temperatures range from 75.2 degrees
00:05:10
Fahrenheit to 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit across the islands. Let's pause here and review what we've learned so far.

! Section 8
00:00:00
TEACHER: In this lesson, we are working to answer the question, how can you describe the geography of the Western Hemisphere? So far we have learned to describe the physical geography of the Western Hemisphere, which included mountain ranges, peninsulas and isthmus, islands, deserts, and bodies of water.
00:00:18
Now we are going to move on as we learn about the human geography of the Western Hemisphere. Now human geography is the study of how humans interact with their environment. It also includes studying different regions, countries, and cities, as well as the population. Now let's explore the human geography of North America.
Section 9
00:00:00
TEACHER: Another way in which we can describe the human geography of the Western Hemisphere is by describing the countries that make up North America. Now there are three countries that make up North America. Here they are, Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Here you can see the countries represented on the map. Remember, it's really important that Alaska and Hawaii are also
00:00:22
part of the United States. When we talk about human geography, we also refer to the major cities in different countries. So let's check out some of the major cities that are part of each of these three countries. So each country in North America has many cities with very distinct characteristics. But let's just take a look at some of the major cities
00:00:40
in North America. So first we see Vancouver, which is located in Canada. Vancouver is a coastal city in Canada with approximately 610,000 people living there. Next we see Washington, DC, which of course is located in the United States. And Washington, DC is the capital of the US. It has approximately 681,170 people living there.
00:01:02
New York City, another US city-- it is actually the most populous city in the United States with approximately 8.3 million people living there. Los Angeles, another US city, located in California. Los Angeles has approximately 3.8 million people living there, and it has the largest Latino and Asian populations in the US. Mexico City, which is located in, you guessed it, Mexico--
00:01:28
Mexico City is the largest city in Mexico with approximately 8.9 million people. And then finally Guadalajara. And Guadalajara is also located in Mexico. And it's known for its cultural events which attract people from all over the world. Let's take a look at the number of people living in each country within North America.
00:01:48
So North America's current overall population is 490 million people. Now North America itself makes up roughly 5% of the total world population. Remember, of course, that population means the number of people living in a particular area. So broken down, this population means that the United States alone has 325,391,466 people.
00:02:15
Canada consists of 36,757,251 people. And Mexico consists of 129,163,276 people. Let's learn about how this population can be represented. So an easy way to show population and any changes that can occur over time is by using a chart. So take a look at this. Here we see a bar chart. And it lists the year on the bottom, which is the x-axis.
00:02:46
And it also lists the population in millions along the y-axis. Now remember that a graph is just a visual way of representing numerical information. Of course the bar chart uses rectangular bars. And these match the values that they represent or the numbers that they're talking about. The bars can be either horizontal or vertical, either way.
00:03:07
And then the title tells what it is that we're discussing, so what the information that's represented. So here we know we're looking at the population in the US, and then specifically over time from the year 1790 to 2010. So if we study the chart closely, we see a steady increase over time in population. And we see an especially big jump from the year 1790 to 1890.
00:03:33
What do you think contributed to the major increase in population during that time? Let's review some of the human geography that we've learned so far.

! Section 12
00:00:00
TEACHER: We can also describe the human geography of South America in terms of the different countries making up the whole continent. So take a look at this map of South America. It shows all the countries that it's made up of. There are 14 different countries making up South America. Go ahead pause the video so that you
00:00:17
can take a look through each of the different countries. I'm sure you'll recognize many of the names as you read through the countries. Next, we're going to learn about some of the major cities within South America. Now, not only can we described the human geography of South America by describing the different countries, as we looked at earlier, we can also
00:00:34
describe some of the major cities of the continent. So let's take a look at some of these major cities. First we’ll look at is Rio de Janeiro, which is located in Brazil. So Rio de Janeiro is a city in Brazil with over 13 million people. It's known for its famous beaches and also its vibrant carnivals.
00:00:53
Buenos Aires is another important city. This one is located in Argentina. It's actually the capital of Argentina and has a population of over 13 million. Another vibrant city, this is also a major port that generates a lot of wealth for the country. Next, let's check out Lima. Lima is located in Peru.
00:01:10
It is the capital of Peru, has approximately 10 million people, and is located between the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. And then finally let's check out Santiago which is located in Chile, the long, skinny country. Santiago is the capital of Chile and it has approximately 6.6 million people. In your next assignment, you'll review
00:01:29
some of the human geography of South America.

! Section 14
00:00:00
TEACHER: Early in our lesson we learned that sometimes information can be represented in a visual format. Take a look at the graph. It shows the population of South America in 2017. We can use the graph to see that the population of Bolivia, for example, is almost exactly 10 million people.
00:00:20
But then if we look just above at Ecuador and Chile, they are almost exactly the same just over. Check out Brazil. It has by far the largest population at over 100 million people. Let's now see how population changes can be represented in a different visual way. This time we're going to look at a thematic map.
00:00:39
So this is another way to show information in a visual way. We can identify different trends using a thematic map. Now, what is a thematic map? It basically shows the distribution of some sort of attribute. This could be rainfall or population density. So this particular map shows the percentage change in population in each South American country,
00:00:59
and this is over a five-year period. So in the title it tells us it's from 2010 to 2015. The colors in the key here represent the different percentages that each country's population has changed over that five-year period. So let's take a look at the map and key. Which country has changed the least in population over those five years?
00:01:20
Take a look. Yep, you're right. That's Uruguay. And what do you think contributes to this? Why has the population changed so much in such a short amount of time? Consider that as we move on to review some of the human geography we've learned about so far.
Section 16
00:00:00
TEACHER: Let's take a closer look at the countries making up both Central America as well as the Caribbean islands. So this map shows those individual countries. First let's check out Central America. The individual countries are Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Belize.
00:00:19
Taking a look at the Caribbean Islands, these are some of the major islands that make up Caribbean islands-- Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and the Bahamas. Some major cities in this group of countries in the islands are also listed. Let's check those out.
00:00:35
We see Guatemala City, which is, of course, located in Guatemala-- Panama City in Panama. We see Havana, which is located in Cuba and Kingston, which is located in Jamaica. Now let's learn about the population of some of these countries. So now that we're familiar with some
00:00:51
of the names of the countries in Central America, as well as the names of those in the Caribbean Islands, let's have a look at the population of some of those countries and islands. So this is a table. Of course, it makes it easier to locate specific countries and their populations. We can use the table to see, for example, that Guatemala
00:01:08
has the largest population of the Central American countries that are listed here. Looking over at the Caribbean islands, we see here that Cuba has the largest population of the islands that are listed here. Now it's time to check your knowledge of these Central American countries and Caribbean Islands.

! Section 18
00:00:00
TEACHER: In this lesson, we are working to answer our question, how can you describe the geography of the Western Hemisphere? So far we have learned to describe the geography of the Western Hemisphere by referring to both the physical geography--which, of course, means mountain ranges, rivers, et cetera--
00:00:16
as well as the human geography. This refers to regions, countries, and population. In the next part of our lesson, we are going to explore the culture of the Western Hemisphere. And these will include the cultures of different people groups, languages spoken, as well as religions practiced.

! Section 19
00:00:00
TEACHER: When learning about the culture of different countries in the Western Hemisphere, it is important to understand what makes up a person's culture. So culture can actually be made up of a number of different things. These could include their beliefs, customs, arts, and language.
00:00:17
Here we see a group of people dancing salsa in an open area in Cuba. That looks fun. This style of dancing is an important part of their culture and an example of one of their arts. Let's explore some of the different cultures throughout North America. So many years before European settlement in North America,
00:00:35
the ancestors of the modern Native Americans' and Canadians' first nations roamed from coast to coast. Remember, of course, that the American Indians are the native people of North America. So there are actually 562 recognized Indian nations. And language, customs, and dress all differ greatly between the tribes.
00:00:57
Some American Indian tribes were actually nomadic. And this means that they didn't have a permanent home. Instead, they moved from place to place. So for example, the Great Plains Indians followed the buffalo migration, as this was their food source. They were hunter-gatherers, and so they moved to find areas where the weather was mild and there was access to plenty of plants
00:01:16
that they needed for food. Take a look at this image. It shows the American Indian family during the 19th century. So with so many different Native American cultures, there were also many Native American languages spoken. It's actually estimated by scholars that there were more than 300 languages spoken by Native Americans at the time of Columbus's arrival.
00:01:37
And that number today has dropped to approximately 175 native languages. Take a look at the map. It shows the colors--and it uses the key, of course-- to distinguish a variety of languages that are spoken by Native Americans all throughout the United States. There are some areas where two languages seem
00:01:54
to be spoken in close proximity or both languages are spoken in that area. So the Algic language, for example, and the Iroquoian, you can see, are both spoken in this region. Language is only one aspect of culture, though. Let's explore some of the others. We can also discuss the culture of North America in terms of its religion.
00:02:14
Here's another table that lists various religions and the percentage of the North American population that practices that particular religion. So this table even indicates not only the current--or excuse me, the population in 2010. It also gives a projected population by 2050. So all the religions are represented here. Let's take a look at them--
00:02:35
Christianity, unaffiliated, Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, other religions, and folk religions. We can see that according to the table, in 2010, Christianity had 77.4% of the population that was practicing this religion. And that made it the largest practicing religion. Folk religions made the smallest practicing religion at just 0.3% of the population practicing.
00:03:04
Taking a look at the other side of the chart at the table, which is the predictions of 2050, we can see that the population of people unaffiliated with religion, which is located here, is said to have the highest growth at 25.6% from just 17.1% of the population. And Christianity is expected to have the lowest growth or the least amount of growth
00:03:28
from 77.4% of the population to just 65.8%. Now since North America's early settlement days, immigration and migration have had a significant impact on culture, as well. So exploration and migration have actually created changes to North American culture. Let's take a look at some of these changes. So one is that there is greater diversity of cultures
00:03:52
represented in North America. So to give you an example of such diversity of culture, consider Vancouver. This is a city in Canada. 49% of Vancouver's population are from an ethnic minority group, such as Chinese or Latinos. Another change due to exploration and migration is employment opportunities being created.
00:04:11
Now migration has increased the population, which has also increased the need for products and services like health care, homes, and roads. And with this demand, it's led to more jobs being created. Another change has been different ideas that have blended together. So different groups have shared their culture, which blends with others to create new ideas--
00:04:33
so for example, soul and blues music. And then another change that's happened is overpopulation in urban areas. Now it's your turn. You'll use this knowledge to identify the effects of immigration and migration on culture.

! Section 21
00:00:00
TEACHER: South America is a land with many diverse cultures today. But really there are two main things that have influenced South America's diverse culture. These are native civilizations and colonization. So the Incas were an ancient civilization that dominated South America between 1400 CE and 1533 CE
00:00:20
in Peru. Check out this image. It shows Machu Picchu, which is located in Peru. And it is a citadel built by the Inca civilization in the 15th century. This structure is serious evidence that the Incas really had architectural skill and sophisticated understanding of astronomy as well.
00:00:38
European cultures were later introduced to South America when the Spanish and Portuguese colonized it. Remember that colonized means to take over and move into a place. So the Spanish and Portuguese introduced their religion, their language, and culture to South America when they colonized the area.
00:00:56
So colonization has played a significant role in increasing the number of languages spoken in South America. European colonial powers brought their languages to the colonies in South America. Essentially they introduced their European languages. Prior to colonization, the different indigenous tribes spoke their native languages-- for example, Quechua, Nahuatl,
00:01:19
or Guarani European missionaries, some of them developed writing systems for some of the native languages. Take a look at the map. You can use it to identify all of the various languages that are spoken throughout Central America. You can see the key here shows the different colors that indicate the languages that are spoken. If you use the key and take a look at the map,
00:01:39
the largest population groups appear to be Spanish and Portuguese. You can see those are the largest areas on the map. And then the smallest populations of languages spoken are French and Dutch, just this little area here. Next, we're going to explore another aspect of culture, religion. Because remember, colonization played a significant role
00:02:00
in religious culture in South America as well. So the European colonial powers introduced their religion as well as their languages. European colonization contributed, as we said, to languages and to religion that are now present in South America. Catholicism is the most-practiced religion in South America.
00:02:19
Check out the map. Notice that the continent is largely dominated by Roman Catholic. There are a few smaller areas. And some of those other religions that are practiced are Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism. It is common for people also to mix elements of their native religion with Roman Catholicism
00:02:37
because it is the dominant religion. In more recent times, people in South America have sought to preserve their native culture in other ways as well. Take a look at some of the ways they're looking to preserve their culture. First, they might reduce the foreign influence. So teaching and speaking native languages
00:02:54
is one way that native people have sought to do this. Additionally, they might increase the influence of indigenous populations. They could do this too by expanding native-language programs or creating materials and media specifically in the Quechua language. Media such as Google search and Microsoft Windows are actually now available in Quechua.
00:03:15
Quechua is both the name of the tribe and the language of the South American people in the Central Andes region. OK, let's pause here and review what we've learned about culture in South America.
Section 23
00:00:00
TEACHER: When looking at the culture of Central America and the Caribbean, we can quickly find that they have many similarities with the cultures of other regions within the Western hemisphere. So there are three things that have influenced the culture of Central
00:00:14
America and the Caribbean. First, all four regions were colonized. And the Spanish colonized South America, the Caribbean, and Central America. All four regions experienced numerous wars, as well, and these wars were usually over their independence. The Caribbean, South America, and North America all also held enslaved people from Africa.
00:00:36
As we've seen before, all these experiences shape the culture of these regions, including the language. So let's take a look at that first. So speaking of the language, let's take a look at what's spoken throughout the Caribbean. The striped areas, remember, are where those two different languages are spoken.
00:00:52
Although there are native languages that are spoken throughout the region, there are six languages, as you see listed here, that are considered the official languages of this region. Some of these languages are European languages, of course, due to the influence of colonization. Papiamento is actually a Portuguese- and Spanish-based creole language, as a result of Spanish and Portuguese
