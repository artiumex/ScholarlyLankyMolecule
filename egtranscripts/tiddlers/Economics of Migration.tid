    00:00:01 KIRSTEN PITTMAN: Hi, my name is Kirsten, and I'll be your instructor today. Well, have you ever had a family member who emigrated to the United States, or maybe you know someone who's recently arrived here in this country from another country? Immigration is a very long and difficult process. It's a very challenging process. Can you imagine what new challenges face people who
    00:00:25 have recently arrived in the United States? How do they find the right schools? How do they find a place to live? What kind of jobs might they be looking for? And how do they get hired into those positions? Well, in this section, we're going to be learning about the economics of migration, and the factors that affect where people choose to live, and the factors that affect the
    00:00:46 economies of both their new country and their old country. This lesson is titled Economics of Migration. Our objectives-- to identify recent patterns of human migration for economic purposes, to examine the impact of remittances on migrant workers' home countries, to understand the impact of migrant workers on the economies of their country of employment, and to analyze the socioeconomic consequences
    00:01:11 of migration. In this section, we'll be looking at the first objective. And some of our words and terms will be highlighted in purple. Remember these are part of your vocabulary for this lesson. OK.
    00:01:21 So let's talk about what is an immigrant? And what is an emigrant? So these words can be very confusing. So I'm going to get my pen out here, and you can see there's immigrant that starts with an I and emigrant that starts with an E. Well, an immigrant is a person who immigrates from one economy or country to another. So an immigrant is someone who is coming to
    00:01:43 America, for example. An emigrant is someone who is leaving a country. So an emigrant is someone who is leaving, and an immigrant is someone who's coming. So don't get confused with those two terms. I usually just remember the I and the E, that's how I remember the difference between the two. Immigrant populations are growing in high-income
    00:02:04 countries, as more and more people are coming to high-income countries in order to find employment. And employment is a very important push and pull factor with regard to immigration. It pushes people out the door of their old countries. They can't find jobs. Their standard of living is very low. And the country they choose has to do with
    00:02:26 employment as well. So people choose Western Europe, they choose the United States, again, because typically these countries have more vibrant economies, the wages are higher, and therefore they'll will be able to increase their standard of living. Now many people who come to the United States temporarily to work, or come to Western Europe temporarily to work,
    00:02:47 may remain permanently in their new countries. However, some work temporarily, and often send money home to their families back in their home countries. Some people are not coming over for jobs, but instead are coming over for education. They may want an advanced degree. Perhaps their country doesn't have the same high quality standard of higher education that we have
    00:03:10 here in this country. And sometimes the social conditions may make attending school more challenging. Maybe their country is at war, conflict. Or maybe because they're a woman, for example. Often in many parts of the world, women aren't seen as equal to men, so they come to the United States where they feel they will get a better shot at a good education.
    00:03:31 All right, on the next two slides we're going to take a look at something called migration flows. Migration flows are historical trends. When we see large groups of people moving from one place to another. Recently, we've seen a large number of immigrants move from places like South America, Central America, and Mexico to the United States.
    00:03:55 So this includes emigrants who are moving permanently, and migrant workers who may move temporarily and send money home. This includes skilled labor as well as unskilled laborers who work in agriculture, manufacturing, and domestic service. And it includes people with advanced degrees who find work in professional fields.
    00:04:13 A great example is doctors in the United States are in great need. We have a growing segment of our population who's growing older. And often we see people come from other countries, who've gone to medical school in other countries, come and find work in the United States as physicians, because again they can be paid much better, they can have a higher standard of
    00:04:35 living, here in the United States than they might enjoy back home. Another very common modern migration flow that we're seeing are large numbers of immigrants and migrant workers who are going to Western Europe. They're coming from Eastern Europe, into Western Europe from Africa, Asia and the Middle East. And also we're seeing happen is people are coming from
    00:04:57 their country, often to the colonial power that oversaw their region. So for example, people who live in India, it used to be part of Great Britain's empire, so they move from India to Great Britain to work. The same thing with Algeria. France used to control Algeria, so people may move from Algeria to France as well.
    00:05:18 So that's another very common-- we're also seeing a lot of professionals, so we're seeing people in the computer industry, technology industries, medical field, going to Western Europe, as well. OK. So let's take a look at what exactly is a migrant worker. A migrant worker is a person who works in a country in which he or she does not hold citizenship.
    00:05:41 So in the United States, we often use the term migrant worker to discuss illegal immigrants, but that's not the global definition. No, that's not the definition that you typically see elsewhere. It's just someone who doesn't intend to stay in the host country. It's someone who's going to come over, and they're going
    00:06:00 to earn some money. They're going to send money back while they're working, and then hopefully return back home. So that's the difference between a migrant worker and a immigrant. So globally again, that term is used to describe people that are in a new country on a work visa. They are there legally.
    00:06:16 They are working legally, but often in the United States, you will hear this term to describe someone who is working in the United States illegally. OK. Next let's talk about what a seasonal worker is. A seasonal worker describes someone who moves from one seasonal job to another. So the worker may come from another country than the one
    00:06:40 they are seeking employment. But it's often used to describe people who are engaged in manual labor in the agricultural field. So again, a seasonal worker might be someone who is following the harvest. Commonly, this was done in the United States. We had a program called the Bracero program, immediately after World War II.
    00:06:59 So many of the people were there fighting in Europe, so there was a big demand for agricultural labor, because again in addition to feeding the troops and beating the country, a lot of our food was being exported to England and elsewhere in Europe. So there was a high demand for agricultural workers. So the United States invited Mexican citizens in to come work in agricultural fields temporarily, and then they
    00:07:22 would return to Mexico. So again, they are traveling with the harvest. You know, they would start out south, then move northward as more and more crops came into ripeness. So let's talk about challenges for migrant workers. Again, migrant workers are people who are here temporarily or in a new country temporarily and often send money home.
    00:07:43 First is language barriers. Many times, migrant workers do not have high school degrees. They're typically less educated than the average American citizen. And on top of that, generally, they're speaking another language. Often, they are working in unsafe working conditions in some areas.
    00:08:01 They're often being taking advantage of, not being paid minimum wage, for example. They're not receiving health insurance. They're not getting the same types of workmen's compensation benefits. So if they're hurt on the job, they're fired and not taken care of. Also they're among the first to lose their jobs when an
    00:08:22 economy is hit hard. So it's very difficult to be a migrant worker. So let's take a look at farm workers here in the United States, many of whom are migrant workers. On average, the highest grade completed is seventh grade. 81% speak Spanish as a first language, and 75% of migrant farm workers in the United States were born in Mexico. Unauthorized workers, so that means people that are not
    00:08:49 legally cleared to work here in the United States averaged 497 days of work. People that were here legally averaged only 175 days of work. So typically unauthorized workers are working more days than authorized workers. 53% of the workers on farms in the United States are unauthorized to work in the United States.
    00:09:13 So 53% of farm workers do not have valid work visas or are not citizens. 16% of the labor force are foreign-born newcomers, meaning they have recently arrived here in the United States. Again, the authorized workers averaged 185 days of work. 23% report having some type of health insurance. And their average income is between $10,000
    00:09:38 and $12,000 per year. That is below the poverty level. In fact, 30% of all farmworkers live below the poverty level. So in review, the reasons for migration include economic and educational benefits, and migrant and seasonal work as well. And so economic is really the most important reason.
    00:10:00 That's why people come to America. That's generally why people come to Western Europe. They're looking to increase their salaries. They're looking to sometimes take care of people back home. And they're looking to increase their standard of living and way of life. We talked about two modern migration flows, those people coming from Latin America to the United States and Asian
    00:10:22 and African migration to Western Europe. We also discussed farm and migrant workers here in America. They struggle with pay, equal rights, culture barriers, and living wages. Thank you very much. And I'll see you next time.

! Section 2

    00:00:02 PROFESSOR: Hi, welcome back. This lesson is Economics of Migration. Our objectives for this lesson are here. And in this section, we'll be looking at our second and third objectives-- to examine the impact of remittances on migrant workers home nations, and to understand the impact of migrant workers on the economies of their country of
    00:00:18 employment. So let's get started. In this section, we're going to talk about how migrant workers affect the economies of the world. And there's two big ways they do this. First, by providing remittances to the home country and then by filling the employment needs of the host country.
    00:00:34 And we're going to talk about remittances first. So first, that's likely a term you are unfamiliar with. What is a remittance? Well, a remittance is money sent home to a family. So, for example, if you're a migrant worker and you're working in another country, and you're trying to help your parents and family back home, you might take a portion of your paycheck and send it to them to help your family.
    00:00:56 And remittances are very important to developing economies. And the way I'd like you to think about this is in many countries of the world, the average family income for a whole year is $300 or $400. So imagine the impact of $40 or $50 a month that would mean for a family living in one of these countries. So people that are from very, very poor countries often move
    00:01:20 to more wealthy countries. They earn a paycheck. And then they just take $40 or $50 and send that back home. And that can make a huge difference on the impact of the lives of the people they have left behind. Now this money creates purchasing power, which mean families can start to buy the things they need, medical care, food, better education, and so forth.
    00:01:41 And this money flows into that country's economy. So it's very beneficial to developing economies. Now remittances, larger countries receive more monies in remittances. So, for example, in 2004, India, China, and Mexico were the top three recipients of remittances. The United Nations estimates that in 2007, the three countries received more than $94 billion dollars in
    00:02:08 remittances. And in case you're wondering about how much of that money came from the US, well, all in all, migrant workers from the US, that are working in the US, spent about $45 billion dollars in remittances back home. So again, people don't just come to the United States. They go to countries in Western Europe. People actually go to countries like India and China
    00:02:28 as well for better jobs. But all in all, these three countries receive the most money in remittances. Now on top of that, remittances make up a large percentage of the gross domestic product in smaller countries. So, for example, in 2004, more than 25% of the GDP of Tonga, Moldova and Lesotho came from remittances.
    00:02:50 25% is a huge percentage. If you think about all the money that is generated in these economies, 25% of the money came from somewhere else. So that's a huge, huge percentage. Next, we're going to talk about the effects of migrant workers on the host countries. And there's two main ways.
    00:03:10 First, migrant workers fill immediate employment needs, and more people are then able to access goods and services. And we know that when people spend money in an economy, their economy grows. So migrant workers also contribute to their host nation's economy. So let's talk about countries of employment. Migrant workers often fill immediate employment needs.
    00:03:32 And sometimes this can be medical professionals. We've seen this, especially here in the United States, as we have an aging population. There aren't enough doctors. So doctors from other countries come to the US-- we have a better standard of living here. They can make more money here-- to fill those immediate employment needs.
    00:03:49 Agriculture and many industries also have large numbers of migrant workers working in them, as well as education and domestic service and hospitality. Now as a result, there are more people are able to access goods and services. This increases supply and demand, which is also been beneficial for the host country. It increases profits of the companies that are operating.
    00:04:11 And more money circulates in the economy. So migrant workers also benefit their host nation's economy as well. So let's take a look at a country that has large numbers of migrant workers. This is the United Kingdom. And we're looking at the time period between 2002 and 2006. Over two million foreign-born workers were
    00:04:31 in the United Kingdom. And those workers contributed $87 billion to the British economy. Migrant workers also often support jobs for others within the economy. And in this case, migrant support created 200,000 other jobs in the UK. Migrant workers pay about $32 million in taxes and national
    00:04:54 insurance in the UK during this timeframe. And migrant workers contribute $195 million dollars to the British Gross Domestic Product. So we can see the effect of migrant workers on the British economy on these slides. Next let's take a look at migrant workers around the world. Migrant workers are still an important part of the
    00:05:13 workforce in many different countries and in many different industries. Often, migrant workers are willing to take jobs that perhaps members of the host nation are are not. So I'd like you to take a second and think about jobs maybe that are less desirable in our own economy. What kind of job? What is your dream job?
    00:05:31 And then what are the other jobs you're willing to settle for? Well, often what happens is that migrant workers fill those needs, the jobs that nobody really wants. So it can be in industries like domestic service, so working as housekeeping in hotels or cleaning homes, unskilled farm work, landscaping work, and unskilled factory work.
    00:05:53 Typically these jobs do not pay as well as other jobs within our economy, but again when you consider where these people are coming from, it's very, very, very good wages, much better than what they could earn back home. Now these jobs are extremely important. They create a foundation for an economy and then allow people to do other types of jobs. So it's very important that these particular
    00:06:13 positions are filled. Now skilled migrant workers, these are people that are professionals, that come with a great deal of education and training, they also contribute to the foreign economy. They often leave their home economy at a disadvantage. Because what we see happen is when these great, great, talented people that are doctors and lawyers and all these great skills, leave their home country for better
    00:06:37 opportunities elsewhere, often, their home country begins to suffer. Because those are the best earners within that country's economy. And so that's a huge loss for the country in which they leave. So in review, we talked about workers' remittances. Billions of dollars are sent from the
    00:06:53 United States each year. Money earned here is sent to other countries, and it contributes to those countries' economies. It makes up a large percentage of some developing nation's income. Now workers also affect an economy. Migrant workers are in foundational jobs that allow for other jobs.
    00:07:12 They help create other jobs, and sustain other jobs. They also often also take jobs that no one else is really willing to take. And workers also contribute to the nation's well being. But they do spend fewer dollars than other people typically spend. Because much of their money often is sent back home. So we're going to take a break--hang on-- and when we
    00:07:31 get back, we'll talk about the socioeconomic effects of migration. So I'll see you in just a second.

! Section 3

    00:00:01 KRISTEN PITTMAN: Hi, my name is Kristen, and I'll be your instructor today. This lesson is titled Economics of Migration. Our objectives for this lesson are listed here, and in this section, we're looking at the fourth and last objective, to analyze the socioeconomic consequences of migration. Well, in this lesson, we've been learning about migration, why people choose to permanently move from one
    00:00:24 country to another. And we've learned it has a great deal to do with economics. People are looking for a better life. They're looking for more money. They're looking for a higher standard of living. Of course, there's other factors that are also important, including fleeing disaster, fleeing war and
    00:00:39 conflict, and looking for religious or political freedom. Now as a result, however, migration can have significant consequences for the countries that lose the most people. This can mean a loss of skilled workers. It can also mean economic losses. So if a country's-- all of their doctors and lawyers leave to come to a
    00:01:01 country where they can make more money, that has social and economic consequences in the country that they leave. The same thing happens if the wealthy people of a country choose to leave, no longer are they spending their wealth within that country helping that economy grow. So even though migration can benefit the individuals who choose to migrate, it often can have some rather significant economic and social effects in the country
    00:01:27 in which they're departing. So let's take a look at something called the Brain Drain. This is the nickname we give for the flight of human capital. And by human capital flight, we mean the best and brightest that are leaving a country, the loss of talented, skilled, and educated individuals as a result of
    00:01:48 migration out of the country. So again, this can have a significant impact, especially in some of the poorer parts of the world. As people get great education, for example, if we look at a country like India or China, many of these students choose to come to the United States, go to Western Europe, to get their university degrees. But what often happens is they stay.
    00:02:13 And they never go back home. So they're not bringing that education with them to make their own countries better. So this is called the Brain Drain or it's also called human capital flight. And often people don't go back home, because of a lack of opportunity, a lack of resources, a lack of having the potential to make a good living, make lots of money,
    00:02:36 political climates, religious climate, those can all lead people to choose to stay where they receive their education or to temporarily migrate for employment and then never go back home, because the new country provides so many more opportunities or better social conditions or better political freedom or whatever it is that is most important to them. So islands, small nations, unstable nations, and impoverished countries are the ones most affected.
    00:03:08 So for example, more than 50% of university educated professionals from Central America and Caribbean countries live abroad. Now, just think about that. Of all of the people in many of these countries, half of them that received college educations chose to not come back. Or they took their education and left.
    00:03:27 And another society is benefiting from that education. Imagine if suddenly half of all Americans with college degrees left America and went elsewhere. Think about what that would do to our economy, think about what that would do to our number of doctors in our country, the number of lawyers in our country, professionals, scientists, school teachers, all of those things affect the
    00:03:51 country as a whole. It affects our educational growth. It affects our children. It affects our economic prospects. So it's a very, very serious problem. Another example, eight out of ten Haitians and Jamaicans with college degrees live outside of their country. So 80% of people who are from Jamaica or Haiti and have
    00:04:11 college degrees are living elsewhere. So again, Haiti is not getting the benefit from having all of these people with college degrees within its own country, within its own economy, within its own government. So let's take a look at another country facing a brain drain. And that's the country of Iran.
    00:04:30 Iran is located here in the Middle East. You can see it here. The capital of Iran is Tehran. And Iran is another country that has been undergoing what's called a brain drain. About 150,000 of Iran's most educated citizens are leaving the country each and every year. So often what happens is they either study abroad or they
    00:04:54 work temporarily abroad in foreign countries, often in the United States and Canada or in Europe and sometimes even Australia. And after living and working in these new countries, they choose to not return. The migration has resulted in more than 2 million people leaving Iran for these countries in less than 30 years.
    00:05:15 Now some of the factors encouraging the migration of people out of Iran include the Islamic revolution in 1979. After 1979, the Shah of Iran was deposed. An Islamic government was put in its place. This government has at its heart religious principles. So the laws within the country are based on religious principles, and so many people are unhappy with this event. Many people find that type of government incompatible with
    00:05:44 their own personal beliefs. And this particular type of government can be oppressive towards women. So it has definitely affected college educated women, for example. In addition, Iran's economy has struggled because it's so dependent upon oil. As a result, the economy fluctuates greatly with the
    00:06:05 price of oil. And there is a lack of opportunity in many fields, as a result of this less vibrant economy. So let's compare the labor force in Iran and the United States. We can see here in Iran, we still have a significant amount of our country engaged in agriculture, about 25%. And then we have industry and services.
    00:06:29 And services would include everything from being a doctor, a lawyer, health care. It would include things like banking and finance. And now let's take a look at the United States. We can see farming, forestry, or fishing is less than 1%. But we have a great deal of people in service industries. So sales in office, 25%. Manufacturing transportation, 23%.
    00:06:54 Professional and technical. 35% and then other services. So the United States, about 75%, if you were to break it just by service industry, 75% of Americans are engaged in service industries. And so if you think about I'm from Iran and I'm a doctor, the opportunity is going to be much better here in the United States.
    00:07:16 Or I'm a computer programmer. or I'm a finance or a financial analyst or something like that. The opportunity to make more money, the standard of living, is going to be better in the United States. So there is a definite draw to working and living in that kind of economy. as opposed to the economy of Iran.
    00:07:36 So let's take a look at Iran's economy, and see why this exists. Number one, it's highly dependent upon oil and oil revenue. As a result, it fluctuates wildly because the price of oil tends to fluctuate wildly. Secondly, much of the economy is state-controlled. Much of the government is controlled again by the
    00:07:56 religious factions. Social behaviors are also controlled by religious law, and as a result, the opportunity for freedom, the opportunity for expression, the opportunities for women, are limited. Again, because of this very strict state controlled approach, not only towards the economy, but towards religion and social life as well.
    00:08:18 So let's take a look first at Gross National Income. This is what the average if we were to divide the entire economic production by the number of citizens we have. We see Iran's is not bad. It's in the middle. This is a middle income country. But look at it compared to the United States. It's four times as high in the United States, so the economic
    00:08:39 opportunity is much greater. In addition, unemployment right now in 2008 when this data was taken, the United States is at a pretty high point for unemployment. Typically, we look historically over the last hundred years, the unemployment rate in the United States has been much lower than this. But from 2004 through 2010, and on, we've seen higher
    00:09:03 unemployment rates. But look at the unemployed rate in Iran, 12.5, that's very, very high. And that would be a disaster in United States terms. It's certainly not 12.5, typically, it's much, much lower typically in the United States and 12.5 and for us, to reach twelve point five, we know, we've hit a very, very high marks.
    00:09:25 But it's a rather common unemployment rate in Iran. Finally, this last statistic shows us that every for every 1,000 people, almost three people are choosing to leave Iran each year while for people are coming to the United States. So you can see people are choosing to come into the United States. And people are choosing to leave Iran for other places
    00:09:49 because of the economic conditions there. So let's review what we've discussed. In this lesson, we talked about human capital flight. It's sometimes called brain drain. Its the phenomenon of talented and educated workers, leaving their home country to work in another country. So we're specifically looking at college educated people. These are not your average migrant workers.
    00:10:13 These are doctors. These are people who are scientists. These are university professors. We're looking at the best and brightest in a country and choosing to leave. And we saw that the rates are very high, for example, in the Caribbean, as much as 80% of college educated people from Jamaica, from Haiti, don't even live in those countries.
    00:10:35 They live abroad. Iran is the country we specifically looked at. In the last 30 years, they have lost more than 2 million people. These people have gone abroad, first for education, and then later employment. Or they just fled Iran because the Islamic regime change or they fled Iran to work abroad.
    00:10:54 And most of them have not returned. So in this lesson, we talked about migration and migrant workers, and how they affect the economies of the world. We talked about how migrants and their employment and the money they make in the new country, is often sent back home to help the economies there. And we talked about the benefits that the host country gets in the form of better prices and more availability
    00:11:22 of goods and services. So even you are affected by migrant workers. Many of the foods you eat have been harvested by migrant workers. Many of the products you use have been put together or created by migrant workers. So as a result, what kinds of responsibilities do you think you have towards these people?
    00:11:40 And what can you do to help make their transition easier. And make sure that they get a fair shake here in America. So thank you very much. I'll see you next time.
